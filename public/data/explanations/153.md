# 👔 The RAV: Your Partner in Job Search

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: RAV stands for **Regionales Arbeitsvermittlungszentrum** (Regional Employment Center).

### What the RAV does
If you lose your job, the RAV is the first place you must go. It has two main roles:
1.  **Placement:** They help you find a new job by providing access to job databases, coaching, and training courses.
2.  **Control:** They monitor that you are actively looking for work, which is a requirement to receive unemployment benefits (ALV).

### Structure
RAV offices are organized by the cantons but follow federal rules. In the Canton of Zurich, there are several RAV offices (e.g., in Zurich city, Winterthur, or Wetzikon) assigned to residents based on their place of living.
