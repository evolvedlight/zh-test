# 🇪🇺 Relations with the EU: The Bilateral Path

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The foundations of modern relations between Switzerland and the EU were laid with the **Bilateral Agreements I in 2000**.

### The "Third Way"
In 1992, Swiss voters rejected joining the European Economic Area (EEA/EWR). This put Switzerland in a difficult position.
*   **The Solution:** Instead of joining the EU, Switzerland decided to negotiate a series of sector-specific treaties (the "Bilateral Path").
*   **Bilateral I (2000):** Seven treaties covering areas like the **Free Movement of Persons**, land transport, civil aviation, and trade barriers. They were accepted by 67% of voters.
*   **Bilateral II (2004):** Nine more treaties, including the **Schengen/Dublin** agreements (opening borders and coordinating asylum).

This unique "Bilateral Path" allows Switzerland to participate in the European single market and cooperate on many levels without becoming a full member of the European Union.
