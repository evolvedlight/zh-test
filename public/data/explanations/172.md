# 💸 When the Boss Doesn't Pay

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: If an employer pays too little salary without a valid reason, you can **go to the Labor Court** (Arbeitsgericht).

### Protecting your Wages
In Switzerland, the salary is a core part of the contract. If the boss doesn't pay:
1.  **Reminder:** First, write a formal letter asking for the missing money and setting a deadline.
2.  **Mediation:** If that doesn't work, go to the "Schlichtungsbehörde" (Conciliation Authority). This is a fast and free way to solve the problem without a big trial.
3.  **Court:** If mediation fails, the Labor Court will rule on the case.

### Why not the Police?
The police (d) deal with **criminal** matters (theft, violence). A dispute over a contract is a **civil** matter. The police will not force your boss to pay you; only a court can do that. Stopping work (b) is also risky as it might be considered a breach of contract by *you*.
