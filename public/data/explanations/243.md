# 🇨🇭 Wilhelm Tell: The National Legend

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Wilhelm Tell is a **legendary figure from Central Switzerland who fought against foreign rulers**.

### The Legend
Tell's story is set in the early 14th century.
*   **The Apple Shot:** Because Tell refused to bow to the hat of the tyrannical Habsburg governor **Gessler**, he was forced to shoot an apple off his son's head with a crossbow. He succeeded.
*   **Rebellion:** Tell eventually killed Gessler in the "Hohle Gasse" near Küssnacht, which triggered the uprising of the three original cantons against the Habsburgs.
*   **Symbolism:** Although there is no historical proof that Tell actually existed, he became the ultimate symbol of **Swiss independence**, courage, and the fight for freedom. He is immortalized in Friedrich Schiller's famous play "William Tell" and remains a national hero whose image appears on the 5-franc coin.
