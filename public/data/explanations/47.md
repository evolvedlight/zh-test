# 📜 Who Passes Federal Laws?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The majority of new federal laws are decided by the **National Council and the Council of States**.

### The Legislative Route
1.  **Drafting:** Usually starts with the Federal Council (Government).
2.  **Debate:** The two chambers of Parliament (National Council & Council of States) discuss the law.
3.  **Agreement:** Both must agree on the identical wording.
4.  **Referendum Period:** Once passed, there is a 100-day window for citizens to launch a referendum. If no one collects 50,000 signatures, the law enters into force.

### The Role of the People
While we often say "the people decide" in Switzerland, the *people* only vote if a **Referendum** is launched or if a change to the **Constitution** is required. Most standard laws (the "boring" ones) are passed by the Parliament without ever going to a public vote.
