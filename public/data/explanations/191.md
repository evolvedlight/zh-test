# 👶 Naming Your Child

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: If parents do not have a common family name, the child's surname **must be decided by the parents at the time of marriage**.

### The Rules (ZGB)
Since 2013, the rules for names in Switzerland have changed:
*   **Marriage:** Each partner keeps their own name by default, OR they choose a common family name (either the husband's or the wife's).
*   **Children:**
    *   If the parents have a **common family name**, the child automatically gets that name.
    *   If the parents have **different names**, they must decide at the wedding which name (Mother's or Father's) their children will carry.
*   **Unmarried Parents:** The child usually gets the mother's name, but if they have joint custody, they can choose the father's name.

### Why?
This law promotes gender equality by removing the "father's name by default" rule (b). It gives families the freedom to choose while ensuring that all siblings have the same family name.
