# 🗳️ The 4-Year Election Cycle

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Eligible voters elect the Federal Parliament every **4 years**.

### The Legislature
The Federal Assembly (Bundesversammlung) consists of:
1.  **National Council (Nationalrat):** 200 seats, representing the people.
2.  **Council of States (Ständerat):** 46 seats, representing the cantons.

### Stability and Predictability
In many countries, the government can call "snap elections" if they lose a majority. In Switzerland, this is **not possible**. The 4-year term is fixed. This provides significant political stability. If a Federal Councillor (minister) resigns mid-term, they are replaced by the Parliament, but the Parliament itself stays until the next 4-year mark.

### Next Dates
Recent elections were in 2019 and 2023. The next national elections will be in **October 2027**.
