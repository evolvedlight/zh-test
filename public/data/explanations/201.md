# 💰 Financial Equalization: Finanzausgleich

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Financial equalization **supports poor municipalities or those with high social costs** in fulfilling their tasks.

### Solidarity between Towns
The "Finanzausgleich" is a mechanism of solidarity within the Canton of Zurich.
*   **The Rich:** Municipalities with many wealthy residents or high-profit companies (like the City of Zurich or Küsnacht) have a lot of tax income. They pay a portion into a central fund.
*   **The Poor:** Municipalities with lower tax income or very high expenses (e.g., for social welfare or many children in schools) receive money from this fund.
*   **Goal:** The aim is to ensure that a child in a poor mountain village gets the same quality of education and services as a child in a wealthy city suburb. It prevents a "race to the bottom" where towns compete only on low tax rates while neglecting public services.
