# 💸 Federal Responsibilities: Monetary Policy

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Confederation** (Bund) is responsible for Switzerland's **monetary policy**.

### How it Works
This task is executed by the **Swiss National Bank (SNB)**, which acts independently. Its mandate is to ensure price stability (keeping inflation low) while considering the country's economic development.
*   **Currency:** The Swiss Franc (CHF) is the only legal tender.
*   **Constitution:** Article 99 of the Federal Constitution outlines this exclusive competence.

### Why not the Cantons?
A unified monetary policy is essential for a stable economy. Imagine if Zurich had a different currency or interest rate than Geneva!
*   Cantons handle **education (schools)**, **police**, and **healthcare**.
*   The Confederation also manages **foreign relations** and the **military**.
