# 💍 Family Law: The Zivilgesetzbuch (ZGB)

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **Zivilgesetzbuch (Civil Code)** regulates personal status, including **marriages and divorces**.

### Scope of the ZGB
The ZGB is one of the most important pillars of the Swiss legal system. It is divided into five parts:
1.  **Law of Persons:** Who is a "person" and when are they legally capable?
2.  **Family Law:** Marriage, divorce, children's rights, and adult protection.
3.  **Inheritance Law:** What happens to property after someone dies?
4.  **Property Law:** Ownership of land and objects.
5.  **Code of Obligations (OR):** Contracts (technically a separate book but part of the same system).

### Why it Matters
The ZGB ensures that private life is governed by clear, national rules. Whether you get married in Zurich or Geneva, the legal requirements and consequences are the same.
