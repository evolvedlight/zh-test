# 🗞️ Media Independence: The Redaktion

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **newspaper editorial team** (Zeitungsredaktion) decides which articles are published.

### Freedom of the Press
In a democracy, the independence of the media is vital.
*   **Article 17:** The Federal Constitution guarantees the freedom of the press, radio, and television.
*   **No Censorship:** Censorship is strictly prohibited. No government agency (c) or "Media Police" (d) is allowed to tell journalists what they can or cannot write.
*   **Responsibility:** The Editor-in-Chief (Chefredaktor) and their team are responsible for the content. They must follow legal rules (e.g., against libel or hate speech) and ethical standards (the "Press Council").

### Pluralism
This independence ensures that citizens receive diverse information from different perspectives, allowing them to form their own opinions for elections and votes.
