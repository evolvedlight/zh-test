# 🏠 The Tenants' Association: Mieterverband

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Tenants' Association (Mieterinnen- und Mieterverband / MV) is an **interest group that represents the rights of tenants**.

### What they do
The MV is the counterpart to the associations of landlords and property owners (HEV).
*   **Advice:** They provide members with legal advice on rental contracts, rent increases, and moving out.
*   **Legal Aid:** They often have insurance that covers the costs of a lawyer in disputes with a landlord.
*   **Politics:** They lobby for stronger tenant protection laws and more affordable housing.
*   **Support:** They help you check if your "Nebenkostenabrechnung" (utility bill) is correct or if you have a right to a rent reduction when interest rates fall.

It is a voluntary association (NGO), not a state authority (a) or a commercial agency (b).
