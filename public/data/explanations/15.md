# 🙏 Fundamental Rights: Freedom of Belief

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **freedom of belief and conscience** (Glaubens- und Gewissensfreiheit) is a fundamental right.

### What it Means
*   **Article 15 of the Constitution:** Every person has the right to choose their religion and philosophical convictions freely.
*   **Worship:** You can profess your faith alone or in community with others.
*   **Protection:** No one can be forced to join a religious community, attend religious acts, or follow religious teachings.

### Historical Context
This is particularly important in Switzerland, which historically experienced religious conflicts (like the Sonderbund War of 1847) between Catholic and Protestant cantons. Today, this right ensures **state neutrality** regarding religion.
