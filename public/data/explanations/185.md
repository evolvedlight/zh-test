# ⚖️ Applying for a Divorce

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: A divorce application can be made by **the wife, the husband, or both together**.

### Types of Divorce
1.  **Mutual Consent:** The couple agrees that they want to divorce and how to split their property and handle child custody. This is the fastest and cheapest way.
2.  **Unilateral (By one partner):** If one partner wants a divorce but the other doesn't, they can apply to the court after living **separately for at least two years**.
3.  **Hardship:** In very rare cases (e.g., severe violence), a person can ask for a divorce before the two-year period is over.

### The Court
In Switzerland, only a **Civil Court Judge** can grant a divorce. Religious divorces have no legal standing. The court ensures that children's interests are protected and that property is split fairly according to the "Matrimonial Property Regime."
