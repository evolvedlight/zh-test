# 🗳️ Influencing Legislation

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Swiss citizens can directly influence legislation by **voting on initiatives and referendums**. This is the heart of "Direct Democracy."

### The Two Main Paths
1.  **Popular Initiative:** Citizens can propose a change to the **Federal Constitution**. They need 100,000 signatures within 18 months to bring it to a national vote.
2.  **Referendum:** Citizens can act as a "brake" on parliament. If they disagree with a new law passed by the National Council and Council of States, they can collect 50,000 signatures within 100 days to force a national vote.

### Why not just parties?
While joining a party (c) is a common way to be politically active, the *direct* influence on specific laws happens through the ballot box. Voting for the Federal Council (d) is not possible for citizens; they are elected by the Parliament.

### Modern Relevance
This system ensures that the government and parliament always consider the "will of the people" during the law-making process, as any controversial law might face a referendum.
