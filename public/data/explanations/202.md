# 🆘 The Last Safety Net: Sozialhilfe

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: If your own income and assets are not enough to cover your basic needs, the municipality provides **Social Assistance (Sozialhilfe)**.

### The Procedure
Sozialhilfe is the very last safety net in the Swiss social security system.
*   **Last Resort:** You only get it if you have no more money in the bank, no insurance benefits (like ALV or AHV), and no family members who are legally required to support you.
*   **The Goal:** It ensures a life in human dignity. It pays for basic food, clothing, housing, and health insurance.
*   **Responsibility:** It is a task of the **Municipality** where you live.
*   **Repayment:** In some cantons (like Zurich), if you later become wealthy (e.g., through a high-paying job or inheritance), you may have to pay back some of the assistance you received.

### Professional Support
The social services of the municipality (Sozialzentrum) do not just give money; they also provide counseling to help you become financially independent again as quickly as possible.
