# 🥔 The Battle of the Cabbages: Sechseläutenplatz in WWII

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: During World War II, the Sechseläutenplatz in Zurich was used as a **potato field** (Kartoffelfeld).

### The "Plan Wahlen" (Anbauschlacht)
During WWII, Switzerland was surrounded by Axis powers and faced a severe shortage of food and fuel.
*   **Self-Sufficiency:** The government launched the "Anbauschlacht" (Production Battle), named after Friedrich Traugott Wahlen. The goal was to make Switzerland self-sufficient in food.
*   **Urban Farming:** Every possible piece of land was converted into fields—including parks, football pitches, and public squares.
*   **Zurich:** On the **Sechseläutenplatz** (the large square in front of the Opera House), people planted potatoes.
*   **Symbolism:** This field became a powerful symbol of the Swiss population's will to survive and resist during the dark years of the war. Today, the square is once again used for public events, festivals, and the famous Burning of the Böögg.
