# 🗳️ Voting Rights for Foreign Residents

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Residents without a Swiss passport are **not allowed to participate in national (federal) votes**.

### The Current Law
At the **federal level** (initiatives and referendums concerning the whole of Switzerland), only Swiss citizens aged 18 and older have the right to vote.
*   **No Exceptions:** This applies to all national votes, whether they are at the end of the year (d) or about initiatives (a/b).

### Cantonal and Communal Differences
While federal law is strict, some cantons (like Jura or Neuchâtel) allow long-term foreign residents to vote on **cantonal** or **communal** matters. However, in the **Canton of Zurich**, foreigners do not have voting rights at any level. To get these rights, one must go through the naturalization process (Einbürgerung).
