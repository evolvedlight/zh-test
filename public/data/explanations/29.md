# 🗳️ Active Voting Right

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: **Active voting right** (Aktives Wahlrecht) means the **right to vote and elect representatives** in elections and votes.

### Active vs. Passive
*   **Active (Voting):** You cast your vote for a party, candidate, or a referendum/initiative.
*   **Passive (Running for Office):** You stand for election (Nationalrat, Ständerat, Bundesrat, etc.) yourself.

### Example
If you are an 18-year-old Swiss citizen:
*   You have the **Active Right:** You can vote for the Nationalrat.
*   You have the **Passive Right:** You can run for the Nationalrat.
*   (If you are 17, you have neither.)

### Restrictions
Only Swiss citizens can vote or run for **federal** offices.
