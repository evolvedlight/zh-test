# 🧒 The Ban on Child Labor: 1877

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Child labor was banned in 1877 because **children were working in factories and could not attend school**.

### The Factory Act (Fabrikgesetz)
In the 19th century, thousands of children in Switzerland worked 12-14 hours a day in textile and embroidery factories. They were cheap labor but suffered from poor health and a lack of education.
*   **The Law:** The Factory Act of 1877 was a milestone in Swiss social history. It banned children under **14** from working in factories.
*   **Education:** By banning child labor, the state made sure that children could fulfill their duty to attend **Primary School** (which was made mandatory in 1874).
*   **Progress:** This law also limited working hours for adults to 11 hours a day and improved safety conditions.

This was one of the first steps in creating the modern Swiss social safety net and ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their background, receive a basic education.
