### History

*   **1848:** The white cross on a red field became the official flag of the newly formed federal state.
*   **The Red Cross:** The international humanitarian organization "Red Cross" (founded in Geneva) reversed the Swiss flag (red cross on white) to honor Switzerland and its neutrality.

### Symbolism
The flag represents freedom, honor, and the unity of the cantons. It is a source of great pride and is frequently seen on public buildings, mountain peaks, and chocolate packaging!
