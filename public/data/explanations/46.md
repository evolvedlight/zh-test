# 🗳️ Voting Sundays: Four Times a Year

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Swiss citizens normally vote **4 times per year** on federal matters.

### The "Abstimmungssonntage"
To keep the political process organized, the Federal Chancellery sets fixed dates for the next 20 years.
*   **Schedule:** Usually one Sunday in February/March, one in May/June, one in September, and one in November.
*   **Multiple Topics:** On each "Voting Sunday," there can be multiple questions. For example, you might vote on a tax law, a pension initiative, and a local construction project all on the same ballot.

### Why so often?
Direct democracy produces many initiatives and referendums. By bundling them into four fixed dates, the state makes it easier for citizens to stay informed and for the administration to organize the process efficiently.
