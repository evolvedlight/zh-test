# 🏫 The 11-Year Compulsory Education

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Compulsory schooling in Switzerland (including Zurich) lasts for **11 years**.

### The Breakdown (HarmoS Model)
*   **Kindergarten:** 2 years (usually starting at age 4).
*   **Primarschule (Primary):** 6 years (Grades 1-6).
*   **Sekundarstufe I (Secondary):** 3 years (Grades 7-9).

### Right and Duty
Education is both a **right** (every child has access to high-quality public schools for free) and a **duty** (parents are legally required to ensure their children attend school). This foundation ensures that all residents have the basic skills needed for vocational training or higher education, which is crucial for the Swiss economy and social cohesion.
