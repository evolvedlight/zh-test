# 💍 Marriage Rules: No Bigamy

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In Switzerland, it is forbidden for a man to be **married to two women at the same time** (Bigamy/Polygamy).

### Monogamy
The Swiss Civil Code (ZGB) is based on the principle of monogamy. A person can only be married to one other person at a time.
*   **Verification:** Before you can marry at the Civil Registry Office (Zivilstandsamt), you must prove that you are currently single (never married, divorced, or widowed).
*   **Foreign Marriages:** If someone has multiple wives in another country, Switzerland only recognizes the first marriage as legally valid.

### What is PERMITTED:
*   **Living together (a):** "Concubinage" (unmarried partners living together) is very common and perfectly legal.
*   **Adults with parents (b):** There is no law against an adult living in their parents' home.
*   **Single fathers (d):** A man has every right to raise his children alone.
