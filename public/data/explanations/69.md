# ⚖️ The Legislative Branch: The Parliament

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: On the federal level, the legislative power (Legislative) belongs to the **Federal Parliament** (National Council and Council of States).

### Tasks of the Legislative
The parliament is the "Lawmaker." Its duties include:
1.  **Creating Laws:** Debating and passing new federal acts.
2.  **Budgeting:** Deciding how much tax money is spent on what (e.g., roads, army, social welfare).
3.  **Election:** Electing the government and judges.

### Sovereignty of the People
In Switzerland, the "Legislative" is shared with the **People**. Because of the Referendum and the Initiative, the people can act as the "Supreme Legislative Power." If the Parliament passes a law, the people can "veto" it. This is why Switzerland is called a **direct democracy**.
