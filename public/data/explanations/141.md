# 💰 The 3rd Pillar: Private Savings

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **private pension** (private Vorsorge) is the **third pillar** of the Swiss retirement system.

### Pillar 3a vs. 3b
1.  **Pillar 3a (Restricted):** This is the most popular form. You can save a certain amount each year in a special bank account or insurance policy.
    *   **Benefit:** You can **deduct** the full amount from your taxable income, saving a lot of money in taxes.
    *   **Restriction:** The money is "locked" until you retire (with exceptions like buying a house, starting a business, or leaving Switzerland permanently).
2.  **Pillar 3b (Unrestricted):** General savings, life insurance, or property. No specific tax benefits, but you can access the money at any time.

### Why do it?
The 1st and 2nd pillars usually only cover about 60% of your previous income. If you want more security or a higher standard of living in old age, the 3rd pillar is a powerful voluntary tool.
