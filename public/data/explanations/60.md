# 🪜 The Three Levels of Government: The Confederation

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The highest level of the Swiss federal system is the **Confederation (Bund)**.

### The Power Hierarchy
While we call it "highest," it is more about the **scope** of tasks:
*   **The Bund:** Handles matters that affect the **whole country** (Foreign policy, Military, Currency, Customs, National Highways).
*   **The Canton:** Handles matters that affect the **regional level** (Police, Education, Healthcare).
*   **The Municipality:** Handles **local** matters (Waste management, Local roads, Fire department).

### Sovereignty
The cantons are technically "sovereign" in all areas where the Constitution does not explicitly give power to the Bund. This means the Bund is actually "limited" by the Constitution, while the cantons have the "residual power." This makes Switzerland one of the most decentralized countries in the world.
