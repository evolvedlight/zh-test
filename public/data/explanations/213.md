# 🇨🇭 The Birth of Modern Switzerland: 1848

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In 1848, the **modern Swiss Federal State (Bundesstaat) was founded**.

### The Turning Point
Before 1848, Switzerland was a loose "Confederacy of States" (Staatenbund), more like a small version of the EU. Each canton had its own currency, its own army, and its own borders.
*   **Civil War:** In 1847, a brief civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out between Catholic-conservative and Liberal-Protestant cantons. The Liberals won.
*   **The Constitution:** In 1848, a new Federal Constitution was passed.
*   **Results:**
    1.  Switzerland became a **unified nation** with a central government (Federal Council) and parliament.
    2.  The **Swiss Franc** was introduced as the single currency.
    3.  Internal customs were abolished, allowing free trade between cantons.
    4.  Fundamental rights (like freedom of press and religion) were established.

This transformation made Switzerland one of the most stable and prosperous democracies in Europe.
