# 🇮🇹 Post-War Immigration: Italy

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In the 1950s, most foreign workers came from **Italy**.

### The "Guest Worker" Era
After World War II, Switzerland experienced an unprecedented economic boom. The local labor force was not large enough to staff the growing factories, construction sites, and hotels.
*   **Recruitment:** Switzerland signed a recruitment agreement with Italy in 1948.
*   **Seasonal Workers:** Many Italians came as "Saisonniers" (seasonal workers). They had limited rights, often living in simple barracks and being forced to return home for several months each year.
*   **Integration:** Over time, these "guest workers" settled permanently and brought their families.
*   **Cultural Impact:** Italian immigration had a massive positive impact on Swiss culture, especially food (the "Spaghetti" influence), language, and lifestyle. Today, people of Italian origin are one of the best-integrated groups in Switzerland.
