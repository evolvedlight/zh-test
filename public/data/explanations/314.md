The arc of the Jura mountains, stretching from Geneva to Basel, is the heart of global luxury watchmaking.

*   **History:** The industry grew in the 18th century. Farmers in the Jura valleys began making watch parts during the long, snow-bound winter months to earn extra money.

While the Jura also has agriculture and some textile history, its global reputation is built entirely on the mastery of time.
