# ⚖️ Criminal Law: The Strafgesetzbuch (StGB)

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **Strafgesetzbuch (Criminal Code)** determines which acts are crimes and whether someone must go to prison.

### Principle: "No Punishment without Law"
In a democracy, you can only be punished for something if a law *already existed* saying it was forbidden (Nulla poena sine lege).
*   **Offenses:** The StGB lists everything from minor offenses (like shoplifting) to serious felonies (like murder or robbery).
*   **Sentencing:** It defines the range of punishment (e.g., a fine or a prison sentence of 1 to 20 years).
*   **Aim:** The goal of the Swiss criminal system is not just punishment, but also the **resocialization** of the offender to prevent future crimes.

### Other Codes
The ZGB (b) and OR (a) deal with private disputes between citizens, not with "crimes against the state" or prison sentences.
