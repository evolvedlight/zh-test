# 🗳️ Women's Right to Vote: 1971

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Swiss women have been able to vote and stand for election at the federal level since **1971**.

### The Struggle
Switzerland was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce women's suffrage.
*   **Why so late?** In other countries, the parliament could simply change the law. In Switzerland, the **men** had to vote in a referendum to share their power.
*   **1959:** A first national vote was rejected by a majority of men.
*   **1971:** A second vote was finally successful, with 66% of men saying "Yes."
*   **Today:** Women are represented in all political bodies, from local school boards to the Federal Council and the Supreme Court. Equality is now a fundamental value of the Swiss state.
