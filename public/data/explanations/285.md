# 🗣️ The Romandie: French-speaking Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The region of Switzerland called **Romandie** or **Welschland** is the **French-speaking part of Switzerland**.

### Culture and Identity
The Romandie consists of:
*   **Monolingual Cantons:** Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, and Jura.
*   **Bilingual Cantons (French parts):** Fribourg, Valais, and Bern.
*   **Terminology:** "Romandie" is the French name. "Welschland" is the traditional German name (from "Welsch," an old term for Roman/French speakers).

### Differences
While the Romands are proud to be Swiss, they often have different cultural and political views than the German-speaking majority. For example, they are traditionally more open to the EU and favor stronger social services. This cultural boundary is famously called the **Röstigraben**.
*   **Other options:** The East (a), German-speaking part (c), and Ticino (d) are all separate geographical and cultural entities.
