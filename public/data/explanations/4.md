# 🏢 The Departments of the Federal Administration

### Structure of Government
The correct answer is **(d)**: The Federal Department of Justice and Police (EJPD). The Swiss Federal Administration is divided into exactly **seven departments**, reflecting the seven members of the Federal Council. Each Councilor heads one department.

### The Seven Departments
Unlike other countries with "Ministries," Switzerland has "Departments":
1. **EDA:** Foreign Affairs
2. **EDI:** Home Affairs (Culture, Health, Social Security)
3. **EJPD:** Justice and Police
4. **VBS:** Defense, Civil Protection, and Sport
5. **EFD:** Finance
6. **WBF:** Economic Affairs, Education, and Research
7. **UVEK:** Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications

This system ensures that every major area of governance has direct representation in the supreme executive body. The "Justice and Police" department, for example, handles issues like migration, citizenship, and federal police coordination.
