# 🗳️ The Referendum

**From the official brochure:** "Wenn das Bundesparlament ein neues Gesetz bestimmen möchte, können die Bürgerinnen und Bürger mit einem Referendum eine Abstimmung verlangen."

A **Referendum** gives citizens the power to stop or vote on a law that has already been passed by the Parliament.

- **How it works:** If citizens disagree with a new law, they have 100 days to collect **50,000 valid signatures**.
- **What happens next:** If they succeed, a nationwide vote is held. The law only comes into effect if the majority of the voting population says "Yes".

This makes the referendum a powerful tool of direct democracy, acting as a "veto" against the government and parliament.
