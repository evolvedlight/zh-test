# 🏥 Choosing Your Health Insurance

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: In Switzerland, you have the **freedom to choose your health insurance provider**.

### The Marketplace
*   **Freedom of Choice:** You can choose any of the recognized health insurance companies (Krankenkassen) active in your canton of residence.
*   **Changing Providers:** You can switch companies once or twice a year (usually by the end of November for the start of the next year).
*   **Obligation to Accept:** For the **Basic Insurance (Grundversicherung)**, companies *must* accept every person, regardless of their health, age, or gender. They are not allowed to make a profit on basic insurance.
*   **Premiums:** Even though the benefits are the same, the **prices** (Prämien) vary between companies. It pays to compare!

### Mandatory, not Assigned
While it is mandatory to have insurance (c is wrong), the state does not "assign" you a provider (d is wrong). You must take action yourself.
