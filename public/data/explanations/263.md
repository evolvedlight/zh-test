# 🚄 The Swiss Railway Network: World's Densest

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The Swiss railway network is known as the **densest in the world**.

### Public Transport Excellence
For a small, mountainous country, Switzerland has an incredible concentration of train tracks.
*   **Density:** There is almost no place in the Swiss plateau (Mittelland) that is far from a train station. The network covers over 5,000 kilometers.
*   **Usage:** Swiss people travel more by train per person and year than any other nation in the world (surpassing even Japan).
*   **Precision:** The "Taktfahrplan" ensures that trains run at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 or 60 minutes) and connect perfectly with buses and boats.
*   **Gotthard:** Masterpieces of engineering like the Gotthard Base Tunnel (the world's longest) demonstrate the priority Switzerland gives to rail transport.

### Efficiency
The goal of this dense network is to provide a real alternative to cars, reducing traffic on highways and protecting the environment. It is a major factor in Switzerland's high quality of life.
