# 🗣️ The Four National Languages

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The four national languages of Switzerland are **German, French, Italian, and Romansh**.

### Language Distribution
*   **German (approx. 62%):** Spoken in Central, Eastern, and Northern Switzerland. Note: People speak "Swiss German" (Schweizerdeutsch) in daily life but use "High German" (Hochdeutsch) for writing and formal occasions.
*   **French (approx. 23%):** Spoken in Western Switzerland (Romandie).
*   **Italian (approx. 8%):** Spoken in Ticino and southern valleys of Graubünden.
*   **Romansh (approx. 0.5%):** Spoken in parts of the Canton of Graubünden.

### Status of Romansh
Romansh is a "National Language" (Landessprache) but only a "Partial Official Language" (Amtssprache) at the federal level—meaning the Bund only uses it when communicating with Romansh speakers. The first three are full official languages.

### English?
English is widely spoken as a second or third language and used in business, but it is **not** a national or official language of Switzerland.
