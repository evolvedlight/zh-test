# 👔 Unemployment Insurance: ALV

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Social insurance exists to protect you **if you lose your job**. This is called **Unemployment Insurance (ALV - Arbeitslosenversicherung)**.

### How it Works
*   **Mandatory:** Almost all employees in Switzerland are automatically insured through their paycheck. Part of your salary is deducted every month for the ALV.
*   **Benefits:** If you become unemployed, the ALV pays you a "Taggeld" (daily allowance), usually **70% or 80%** of your last salary, for a certain period while you look for a new job.
*   **Conditions:** You must have worked for at least 12 months in the last two years and you must actively search for new work and report to the Regional Employment Center (RAV).

### Why?
This prevents people from falling into poverty immediately after a job loss and supports them in finding a position that matches their skills.
*   **Other options:** Theft (c) and dental issues (a) are handled by private or supplementary insurance, and divorce (d) is a personal/civil legal matter.
