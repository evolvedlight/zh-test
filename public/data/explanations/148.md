# 💸 Disagreeing with Your Tax Bill

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: If you disagree with your tax bill, you can **file a written objection (Einsprache) with the tax authority**.

### The Process
After you submit your tax return (Steuererklärung), the authority sends you a "Steuereinschätzung" (Assessment).
1.  **Review:** You have **30 days** to check if they accepted your deductions and calculated the income correctly.
2.  **Objection:** If there is a mistake, you must write a letter (Einsprache) explaining why you disagree and providing evidence (receipts, bank statements).
3.  **Correction:** The tax office will review your case and either correct the bill or explain why they believe it is correct.
4.  **Appeal:** If you still disagree, you can take the case to a specialized tax court.

### What NOT to do:
*   **Don't ignore it:** You cannot just send it back (b) or pay only half (a). If you don't object within the 30-day deadline, the bill becomes legally binding, even if it's wrong.
*   **Don't call the police (c):** They have no jurisdiction over tax disputes.
