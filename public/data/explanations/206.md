# 💍 The Civil Registry Office: Zivilstandsamt

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: If you want to get married, you must contact the **Zivilstandsamt** (Civil Registry Office).

### The Legal Procedure
In Switzerland, only a civil marriage is legally valid.
*   **Announcement:** You must report your intention to marry (Ehevorbereitungsverfahren) to the Zivilstandsamt in the municipality where one of the partners lives.
*   **Documents:** You bring proof of your identity and your current civil status (single, divorced, etc.).
*   **The Ceremony:** The marriage ceremony is performed by a "Zivilstandsbeamtin" (civil registrar) in an official room of the municipality.
*   **Registration:** The office then updates the national civil registry (Infostar), officially changing your status from "single" to "married."

### Religious Weddings
While many people also have a ceremony in a church or mosque, this is purely a private and religious matter. It has no legal effect and can only happen **after** you have been married at the Zivilstandsamt.
