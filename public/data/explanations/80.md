# ⚖️ Gender Equality

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Men and women have **basically the same rights** in Switzerland.

### Constitutional Basis
Article 8, Paragraph 3 of the Federal Constitution states: *"Men and women have equal rights. The law shall provide for their equality, both in law and in fact, especially in the family, in education, and in work."*
*   **Wages:** It explicitly states that men and women have the right to equal pay for work of equal value.
*   **Opportunities:** It forbids discrimination in hiring or promotions based on gender.

### Fact vs. Law
While the **law** says they are equal, the Constitution also gives the state the task of ensuring they are equal **in fact**. This involves working on issues like the "gender pay gap," the distribution of domestic work, and representation in leadership roles.
