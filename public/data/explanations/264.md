# 🇪🇺 Main Trading Partner: The EU

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **European Union (EU)** is Switzerland's most important trading partner.

### Economic Interdependence
*   **Exports:** Over 50% of everything Switzerland produces (like machines, watches, and pharmaceuticals) is sold to EU countries.
*   **Imports:** Over 60% of everything Switzerland buys from abroad (especially food, energy, and cars) comes from the EU.
*   **Germany:** Within the EU, Germany is by far the single most important partner for Switzerland.
*   **Agreements:** Because Switzerland is not an EU member, this relationship is managed through a complex system of **Bilateral Agreements** that allow Swiss companies to access the European market.

### Other Partners
While trade with the USA (a) and China (c) is growing and very important, the sheer volume and geographical proximity of the EU make it the undisputed number one partner for the Swiss economy.
