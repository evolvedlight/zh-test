# 💼 Unions: The Voice of Employees

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Trade unions (Gewerkschaften) represent the interests of **employees** (Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer).

### What they do
They act as a counterweight to employers and their associations.
*   **Wages:** They fight for fair pay and minimum wages.
*   **Conditions:** They negotiate for better working hours, safety at work, and more holidays.
*   **Legal Aid:** They provide advice and legal protection to their members in case of trouble with the boss.

### Examples
Major unions in Switzerland include **Unia** (for many private industries) and **VPOD** (for the public sector). About 15-20% of Swiss workers are members of a union. By negotiating collective agreements (GAV), unions help define the working standards for millions of people, even those who are not members.
