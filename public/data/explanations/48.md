# 🗳️ The Double Majority for Initiatives

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: For a federal popular initiative to be accepted, it needs **both a majority of the people (Volksmehr) and a majority of the cantons (Ständemehr)**.

### The Two Requirements
1.  **Volksmehr:** More than 50% of all votes cast nationwide must be "Yes."
2.  **Ständemehr:** In at least 12 of the 23 cantonal votes (counting half-cantons as 0.5), the "Yes" votes must win.

### Why this rule?
This is a federalist protection. It prevents a few large, urban cantons (like Zurich, Bern, and Geneva) from changing the Constitution against the wishes of the smaller, rural cantons. An initiative might have 51% of the total population behind it but still fail because it didn't win enough cantons. This forces proponents to create proposals that appeal to both urban and rural populations.
