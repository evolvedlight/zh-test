# 🏠 Protection of Property

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The Federal Constitution guarantees that **personal property is protected** (Eigentumsgarantie).

### What it Means
*   **Ownership:** You have the right to own things—from your clothes and phone to your house and land.
*   **Freedom to Use:** You can use, sell, or give away your property as you wish, within the limits of the law.
*   **Protection against the State:** The state cannot simply take your property away without a very good reason and a legal basis.

### Expropriation
In rare cases (e.g., to build a national railway or a highway), the state *can* take private land. This is called **expropriation**. However:
1.  There must be a high public interest.
2.  The state must pay **full compensation** (the market price) to the owner.
3.  The owner can challenge the decision in court.
