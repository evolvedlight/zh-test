# 🗣️ The Right to Free Expression

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The Federal Constitution guarantees the **freedom of opinion** (Meinungsfreiheit).

### What it Means
*   **Forming Opinions:** You have the right to form your own views on any topic.
*   **Expressing Opinions:** You can express these views freely through speech, writing, images, or other media.
*   **Sharing Information:** You can spread your views and receive information from others.

### Why is it Important?
Freedom of opinion is the "lifeblood" of democracy. Without it, citizens could not debate the best path for the country, and there would be no real choice in elections.
*   **Limits:** You are not allowed to use this right to spread hate speech, incite violence, or lie about others (slander/libel). The "right to free speech" does not mean "freedom from consequences" if you break the law.
