# ✉️ Voting by Mail: The Preferred Method

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Most eligible voters in Switzerland cast their ballots **by mail (per Brief)**.

### The Shift from the Urn
In the past, everyone had to go to a polling station ("Gang an die Urne") on Sunday morning. Today:
*   **Postal Voting:** Around 90% of voters (even higher in some cantons like Zurich) use the prepaid return envelope provided in their voting packet.
*   **Convenience:** You can fill out your ballot at home, sign the voting card, and drop it in any mailbox.
*   **Early Voting:** You can vote as soon as the packet arrives (usually 3-4 weeks before the deadline).

### The Future: E-Voting
Internet voting (b) is currently in a testing phase in a few cantons for specific groups (like Swiss abroad), but it is not yet available for the general population due to security concerns. Voting by phone (c) is not possible.
