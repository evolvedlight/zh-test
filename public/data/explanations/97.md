# ⚖️ Appointing Federal Judges

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Judges at the Federal Supreme Court are **elected by the Federal Parliament** (National Council and Council of States).

### The Election Process
To ensure the independence of the judiciary from the government, it is not the Federal Council (Executive) that appoints judges.
*   **Term:** They are elected for a term of 6 years and are usually re-elected until they reach the retirement age of 68.
*   **Political Balance:** By tradition, the seats on the court are distributed among the major political parties proportionally to their strength in parliament. This ensures that the court reflects a broad range of legal and philosophical perspectives.
*   **Qualifications:** Candidates must be eligible to vote in Switzerland, but in practice, only highly qualified legal experts (usually with years of experience as cantonal judges or law professors) are chosen.
