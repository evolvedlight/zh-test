# 🌍 Switzerland and Colonialism

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: During Europe's colonial era, Switzerland was able to **establish itself as an industrial nation thanks to access to raw materials** from the colonies.

### A Complex History
Switzerland never had its own colonies (unlike Britain or France). However, it was deeply involved in the colonial system:
1.  **Economy:** Swiss companies bought cheap raw materials (cotton, cocoa, coffee, rubber) from colonized regions and sold finished industrial products back to them. This was a major driver of Swiss industrial wealth.
2.  **Trade:** Swiss trading houses (like Volkart in Winterthur) were major players in global colonial trade.
3.  **Finance:** Swiss banks financed colonial enterprises and missions.
4.  **Slavery:** Some Swiss individuals and companies were involved in or profited from the transatlantic slave trade.
5.  **Science:** Swiss scientists and explorers participated in colonial expeditions.

### Modern Reflection
While Switzerland was officially neutral and had no direct political power over colonies, its economic development was closely tied to the global colonial structures of the time. This history is currently being researched and discussed more openly in Swiss society.
