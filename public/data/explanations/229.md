# 🇮🇹 Roman Architecture: The Amphitheater

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The amphitheater in Avenches (and others found in Switzerland) comes from the **Romans**.

### Aventicum: A Roman Capital
Avenches (Vaud) was known as **Aventicum** in Roman times and was the capital of the Roman Helvetians. At its peak around 150 AD, it had a population of 20,000—larger than many modern Swiss towns!
*   **The Amphitheater:** Used for gladiatorial games, animal hunts, and public spectacles. It could hold up to 16,000 people.
*   **Other Sites:** You can find similar Roman ruins in Vindonissa (Windisch, Aargau) and Augusta Raurica (near Basel).

### Cultural Heritage
The existence of these grand buildings proves that Switzerland was an integrated and important province of the Roman Empire. The ruins are now carefully preserved as key monuments of Swiss history and often host modern cultural events like opera festivals.
