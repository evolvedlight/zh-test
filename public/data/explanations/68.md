# ⚖️ The Judicial Branch: The Federal Court

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: On the federal level, the judicial power (Judikative) belongs to the **Federal Court** (Bundesgericht).

### Tasks of the Judiciary
The courts are independent of the government and parliament. Their job is:
1.  **Interpretation:** To interpret and apply the law to specific cases.
2.  **Protection:** To protect the fundamental rights of citizens.
3.  **Conflict Resolution:** To resolve legal disputes between individuals, companies, or the state.
4.  **Final Say:** The Federal Supreme Court (based in Lausanne) is the highest court in Switzerland. Its decisions are final.

### Separation of Powers
To ensure fairness, judges cannot be members of the government (Executive) or the parliament (Legislative). This prevents the people who *make* the laws from also *interpreting* them to their own advantage.
