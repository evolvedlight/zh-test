# 👴 The 1st Pillar: AHV

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **AHV** (Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherung) is the **first pillar** of the Swiss retirement system.

### The Three Pillars
Switzerland's old-age provision is based on the "Three-Pillar Concept":
1.  **1st Pillar (State Pension / AHV):** Mandatory for everyone. It aims to cover basic living costs (subsistence level).
2.  **2nd Pillar (Occupational Pension / Pensionskasse):** Mandatory for employees. It aims to maintain your previous lifestyle in combination with the 1st pillar.
3.  **3rd Pillar (Private Pension):** Voluntary private savings (like a 3a account) with tax benefits.

### Financing the 1st Pillar
The AHV is financed by current contributions from employees and employers. This is called the "Generation Contract": Today's workers pay for today's retirees.
