# ⚖️ Discrimination in Daily Life

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: If people are denied access to a public facility (like a swimming pool) because of their skin color, this violates the **prohibition of discrimination** (Diskriminierungsverbot).

### Article 8 of the Constitution
This article ensures that all humans are equal. Denying access to public services based on "race" or origin is a clear violation of this fundamental right.
*   **Public Services:** This applies to all state-run facilities (schools, pools, libraries).
*   **Private Services:** Private businesses (like clubs or restaurants) also have to follow anti-discrimination laws. While they have "freedom of contract," they cannot use it to systematically exclude people based on their ethnic origin or religion.

### Seeking Justice
The victims can report such incidents to the police or seek help from advice centers against racism. Such acts of discrimination can be prosecuted under the Swiss Criminal Code (Anti-Racism Norm).
