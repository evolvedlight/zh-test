# 📜 Changing the Constitution via Initiative

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A popular initiative is the tool used to **change the Federal Constitution**.

### The Scope
*   **Target:** You cannot use an initiative to change a normal law (Bundesgesetz). If you want to change a law, you must work through Parliament or use a *Referendum* to stop a new law.
*   **Content:** An initiative can propose adding a new article, deleting an old one, or revising a whole section of the Constitution.
*   **Legal Limits:** The only limit is that the initiative must not violate "mandatory provisions of international law" (jus cogens), such as the prohibition of torture or genocide.

### The Power of the People
Because the people can change the Constitution, they are the "Constituent Power" (verfassungsgebende Gewalt). This makes the Swiss people more powerful than the Parliament in the long run.
