### The Core Definition

### The Procedure
When the police arrest someone, they must follow strict rules:
*   **Reason:** They must inform the person why they are being arrested.
*   **Time Limit:** A person can only be held for a short time (usually 24-48 hours) before they must be brought before a **Compulsory Measures Judge** (Zwangsmassnahmengericht) who decides if the person remains in custody (Untersuchungshaft).
*   **Rights:** The arrested person has the right to a lawyer and the right to remain silent.

### Citizens' Roles
*   **Witnesses (a):** Can provide information and call the police.
*   **Provisional Arrest:** In extreme cases (e.g., catching someone in the act of a violent crime), a citizen can hold a person until the police arrive, but they must call the police immediately.
