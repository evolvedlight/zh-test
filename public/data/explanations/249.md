# 🇮🇹 Roman Legacy in Zurich: Bathing Culture

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The Romans brought their **Bathing Culture** (Badekultur) to Zurich (Turicum).

### Roman Lifestyle
When the Romans settled in Zurich, they brought their Mediterranean lifestyle with them.
*   **Public Baths:** In Turicum (modern-day Zurich), the Romans built public thermal baths. Bathing was not just for hygiene; it was a central part of social life—a place to meet friends, discuss business, and relax.
*   **Thermengasse:** You can still see the remains of these Roman baths today in the **Thermengasse**, a small alleyway in the heart of Zurich's Old Town near the Lindenhof.
*   **Infrastructure:** Besides baths, they also introduced viticulture (wine-making), fruit trees like cherries and plums, and stone masonry.

### Other Options
The Alphorn (c) is a traditional mountain instrument of uncertain origin, and modern tropical houses (d) or Chinese porcelain (b) are much more recent additions to Zurich's culture.
