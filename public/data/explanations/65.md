# 🗣️ Four Languages, One Country

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: There are **4** official national languages in Switzerland.

### The List
1.  **Deutsch (German)**
2.  **Français (French)**
3.  **Italiano (Italian)**
4.  **Rumantsch (Romansh)**

### Why Four?
Switzerland was formed by different regions with different languages coming together voluntarily (a "Willensnation"). To ensure peace and equality, no single language was allowed to dominate.
*   **Federal Level:** All laws are published in German, French, and Italian.
*   **Schooling:** Children usually learn at least one other national language in school (e.g., in Zurich, kids learn French; in Geneva, they learn German).
*   **Parliament:** Members can speak in German, French, or Italian, and their speeches are simultaneously translated.
