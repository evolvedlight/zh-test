# 🏙️ Bern: The Federal Capital

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The City of Bern is politically important because it is the **capital of Switzerland** (Bundesstadt).

### Why Bern?
When the modern federal state was founded in 1848, the founders had to choose a seat for the government and parliament.
*   **Neutrality:** They didn't want to choose Zurich (too powerful economically) or Lucerne (on the losing side of the civil war). Bern was chosen as a compromise.
*   **The Federal Palace (Bundeshaus):** This is the seat of the Federal Council (Executive) and the Federal Assembly (Parliament).
*   **International Presence:** Many foreign embassies are located in Bern.

### Status
Interestingly, the Swiss Constitution does not technically name Bern as the "capital." It calls it the **"Federal City" (Bundesstadt)**. It is the political heart of the country, while Zurich is the financial heart and Geneva the international heart.
