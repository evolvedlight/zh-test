# 🌍 The Grenzgänger (Cross-Border Commuter)

### Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**. A "Grenzgänger" (cross-border commuter) is a person who lives in a neighboring country (Germany, France, Italy, Austria, or Liechtenstein) but travels to Switzerland regularly—usually daily or weekly—for work. They hold a specific work permit known as the **Permit G** (G-Ausweis).

### Economic Importance
Cross-border commuters are vital to the Swiss economy, particularly in border regions like Geneva, Basel, and Ticino. Roughly **380,000 people** cross the border every day to work in Swiss industries, hospitals, and multinational companies. Without them, sectors like healthcare in Geneva or pharmaceuticals in Basel would face severe staff shortages.

### Taxation and Rights
Legally, "Grenzgänger" must return to their main residence abroad at least once a week. Taxation is handled through special double-taxation agreements between Switzerland and its neighbors. 

Typically, they pay taxes in their country of residence, but Switzerland may withhold a source tax (**Quellensteuer**), which is then credited against their home tax bill. They benefit from high Swiss wages while often enjoying a lower cost of living in their home country.
