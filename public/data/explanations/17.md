# 📝 Duty of Every Resident: Registration

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Every resident of Switzerland has the **duty to register in their municipality**.

### What it Means
*   **Arrival:** When you move to a new place (Switzerland or within Switzerland), you must report to the **Residents' Registration Office (Einwohnerkontrolle/Kreisbüro)** within **14 days**.
*   **Departure:** When leaving, you must deregister.
*   **Change:** Any change in personal status (marriage, birth, death) must also be reported.

### Why is it Important?
This register is the basis for everything:
1.  **Voting rights (Stimmregister).**
2.  **Taxation (Steuerregister).**
3.  **School planning.**
4.  **Military service.**
5.  **Social security.**

### Cantonal Context
In Zurich, the **Civil Registry Office (Zivilstandsamt)** handles births, marriages, and deaths, while the **Kreisbüro** handles residency.
