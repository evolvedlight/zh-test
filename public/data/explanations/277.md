### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Most people in Switzerland live in the **Mittelland** (Swiss Plateau).

### The Heart of Switzerland
While the Alps take up 60% of the country's area, only about 20% of the population lives there.
*   **Density:** The Mittelland is the relatively flat and hilly region between the Jura mountains and the Alps. It is the most densely populated part of Switzerland.
*   **Cities:** Almost all major Swiss cities (Zurich, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Winterthur) are located in this region.
*   **Infrastructure:** The main railway lines, highways, and industries are concentrated here.
*   **Agriculture:** It is also the most important region for farming.

### Comparison
*   **The Alps (a):** Beautiful for tourism, but difficult for large-scale living and industry.
*   **The Jura (b):** Less populated, mostly focused on watchmaking and agriculture.
*   **Ticino (d):** A beautiful region in the south, but much smaller than the plateau.
