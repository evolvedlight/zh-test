# ⚖️ Prohibited Actions: Hate Speech

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: In Switzerland, it is strictly forbidden to **publicly insult others because of their origin or religion**.

### The Anti-Racism Law
Since 1995, Article 261bis of the Swiss Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) protects people from:
*   **Hate Speech:** Publicly inciting hatred or discrimination against a person or group based on their race, ethnic origin, religion, or sexual orientation.
*   **Public Insults:** Degrading or discriminating against a person or group in a way that violates human dignity.
*   **Holocaust Denial:** Publicly denying, trivializing, or justifying genocide or crimes against humanity.

### Why?
A peaceful democracy requires respect between different social groups. Hate speech poisons the public climate and can lead to violence.
*   **Punishment:** Violations can lead to fines or even prison sentences.
*   **Public Sphere:** This law applies to things said on the street, in newspapers, or on social media (publicly).
