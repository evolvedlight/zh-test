# ⚖️ The Separation of Powers

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Separation of powers (Gewaltenteilung) means the **distribution of state power among different organs like the government, parliament, and courts**.

### The Three Powers
1.  **Legislative (Parliament):** Makes the laws.
2.  **Executive (Government):** Implements the laws and runs the state.
3.  **Judiciary (Courts):** Interprets the laws and settles disputes.

### Why is this important?
The goal is to **prevent the abuse of power**. If one person or group held all three powers, they could make a law that benefits them, enforce it themselves, and rule that they are right if anyone complained. By splitting these powers, each branch "checks and balances" the others. In Switzerland, we also have the "Vertical" separation: powers are split between the Bund, the Cantons, and the Municipalities.
