# 🗣️ Romansh: The Fourth Language

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: **Romansh** (Rätoromanisch) is spoken in the Canton of **Graubünden** (Grisons).

### A Unique Heritage
Romansh is a descendant of the spoken Latin of the Roman Empire, mixed with Celtic and other ancient languages of the Alps.
*   **Status:** It is one of Switzerland's four national languages.
*   **Trilingual Canton:** Graubünden is the only canton where Romansh is official, alongside German and Italian.
*   **Diversity:** There are five different dialects (idioms) of Romansh, each with its own written standard, though "Rumantsch Grischun" was created as a common administrative language.
*   **Population:** Only about 0.5% of the Swiss population (around 40,000–60,000 people) speak Romansh as their first language.

### Protection
Because the number of speakers is small, the Confederation and the Canton of Graubünden provide special support to protect the language and culture, for example through Romansh-language schools, TV programs (RTR), and newspapers.
