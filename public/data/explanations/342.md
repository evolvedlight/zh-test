# ☃️ The Sechseläuten Prophecy: The Böögg

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Tradition says: The faster the "Böögg" (snowman puppet) loses its head on the bonfire, the **better the coming summer will be**.

### Zurich's Spring Festival
Sechseläuten is the traditional spring festival of the City of Zurich, held on the third Monday of April.
*   **The Böögg:** A 3.4-meter-high snowman filled with wood wool and **firecrackers**. He symbolizes winter.
*   **The Ritual:** At 6 PM, the bonfire on the Sechseläutenplatz is lit. The time from the lighting until the head of the Böögg explodes is measured.
*   **The Legend:** 
    *   Fast explosion (e.g., under 10 minutes): A hot, sunny summer.
    *   Slow explosion (e.g., over 20 minutes): A cold, rainy summer.
*   **Accuracy:** While the Böögg is a beloved tradition, his weather predictions are scientifically proven to be no more accurate than a coin toss!

The event is organized by the traditional Zurich **Guilds** (Zünfte) and is one of the highlights of the city's cultural year.
