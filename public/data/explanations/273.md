# 🌬️ The Warm South Wind: Föhn

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The dry and warm south wind in Switzerland is called the **Föhn**.

### How it Works
The Föhn occurs when moist air from the Mediterranean is forced up the southern side of the Alps.
1.  **Rain in the South:** The air cools as it rises, causing heavy rain in Ticino.
2.  **Heat in the North:** As the air descends on the northern side (towards the Mittelland), it warms up rapidly and becomes very dry.
3.  **Effects:**
    *   **Temperature:** It can raise the temperature by 10-15 degrees in a very short time.
    *   **Visibility:** It creates extremely clear air and blue skies ("Föhnfenster").
    *   **Health:** Some people suffer from headaches or irritability ("Föhnkrankheit").
    *   **Melting:** It is also known as the "snow eater" because it melts snow very quickly in the spring.

### Other Winds
*   **Bise (a):** A cold, dry wind from the northeast.
*   **Brise (c):** A general term for a light breeze.
