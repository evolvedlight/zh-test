# 📝 Reporting Your Move: Einwohnerkontrolle

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: When you move, you must report the change of address to the **Municipality (Einwohnerkontrolle)**.

### The Duty to Report
Whether you move across the street or to a different canton, you have a legal duty to update your registration.
*   **Deadline:** Usually within **14 days** of moving.
*   **Arrival/Departure:** If you move to a new town, you must "deregister" (abmelden) at your old municipality and "register" (anmelden) at the new one.
*   **ID/Permit:** You bring your identity card or your foreign resident's permit to have the address updated.

### Why?
The municipality needs this information for:
1.  **Voting rights:** Ensuring you get the correct voting materials.
2.  **Taxation:** Deciding which town gets your tax money.
3.  **Schools:** Knowing which school district your children belong to.
4.  **Security:** In case of an emergency, the authorities need to know who lives where.
