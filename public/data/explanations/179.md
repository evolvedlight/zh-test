# 💼 Paid Leave for Public Duties

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Employees are entitled to paid time off for the **exercise of a public office** (Ausübung eines öffentlichen Amtes).

### The Miliz Principle
Switzerland relies on its citizens to perform many public tasks alongside their regular jobs.
*   **Examples:** Being a member of a local parliament, a school board, or a judge at a labor court.
*   **Law:** The Code of Obligations (OR Art. 324a) states that employers must grant employees the necessary time off to perform these duties, provided they are of a "public" nature.
*   **Payment:** In most cases, the employer must continue to pay the salary for a certain period, although some of the loss might be covered by "EO" (Income Compensation).

### What is NOT included:
*   **Private Admin (c):** Going to the bank or post office is your private business.
*   **School Start (d):** While some companies are generous, there is no *legal right* to paid leave for the first day of your child's school.
*   **Blackouts (a):** A power failure is a "business risk" for the employer, but not a reason for "paid leave" in the same legal sense.
