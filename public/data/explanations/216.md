# ⛪ The Reformation in Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The important religious movement in 16th-century Europe and Switzerland was the **Reformation**.

### Zurich's Role
Switzerland was a center of the Reformation.
1.  **Huldrych Zwingli:** In **Zurich**, Zwingli (the priest at the Grossmünster) led the break from the Catholic Church. He focused on a strict interpretation of the Bible and simplified religious services.
2.  **John Calvin:** In **Geneva**, Calvin created an even stricter form of Protestantism that spread across the world (Calvinism).

### Impact
The Reformation split Switzerland into Protestant cantons (like Zurich, Bern, Basel) and Catholic cantons (like Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz). This led to centuries of political tension and occasional wars, but it also fostered the Swiss culture of **Compromise** and **Tolerance**, as the different regions eventually learned to live together in a single state while respecting their religious differences.
