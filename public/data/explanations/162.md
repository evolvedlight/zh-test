# 🏫 School Placement: Schulleitung

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Schulleitung (School Management)** or the **Schulpflege (School Board)** decides on the placement of a child in a specific class.

### How it Works
While parents (a) can express wishes, the final decision lies with the school authorities. They consider:
*   **Balance:** Ensuring classes have a balanced mix of genders, languages, and learning abilities.
*   **Geography:** Placing children in the school building closest to their home.
*   **Special Needs:** Deciding if a child needs supportive measures (like "DaZ" - German as a second language) or special education.

### Local Responsibility
In the Canton of Zurich, the organization of primary schools is a task for the **Municipality**. The local school board (Schulpflege) is elected by the citizens and oversees the work of the schools.
