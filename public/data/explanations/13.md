# 🛃 Federal Responsibilities: Customs & Borders

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **Confederation** (Bund) is responsible for **customs**.

### How it Works
The **Federal Customs Administration (FCA)** is part of the Federal Department of Finance. It controls:
*   The **movement of goods:** Ensuring import duties (like VAT and tariffs) are paid.
*   The **security of the border:** Preventing smuggling and illegal entry.
*   **Protection of agriculture:** Enforcing quotas on imported food to protect Swiss farmers.

### Why not the Cantons?
Like the currency, borders are a matter of **national sovereignty**. A canton like Schaffhausen (with a long border with Germany) cannot decide its own import rules.

### Exceptions
Police work *inside* the country is primarily the responsibility of the **Cantons** (e.g., Cantonal Police Zurich).
