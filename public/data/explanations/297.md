# 🌊 Rivers of Zurich: Sihl and Limmat

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In the City of Zurich, the **Sihl** flows into the **Limmat**.

### The Meeting of Waters
The "Sihlspitz" is the point where the two rivers meet, located right next to the **Swiss National Museum** (Landesmuseum) behind the Main Station (HB).
*   **Limmat:** Flows out of Lake Zurich, through the center of the city, and northwards towards the Rhine.
*   **Sihl:** Comes from the Sihl valley (Sihltal), flows under the platforms of the Zurich HB, and joins the Limmat at the Sihlspitz.

### Other Rivers

*   **Rhone (c) / Tessin (d):** Flow through the Valais and Ticino respectively, nowhere near Zurich.
