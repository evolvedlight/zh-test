# 🗳️ Voting Topics on a Federal Level

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Swiss citizens vote on **popular initiatives and referendums** at the federal level.

### Direct Democracy in Action
Unlike many other democracies where you only vote for *people* (representatives), Swiss voters vote on *content* multiple times a year.
*   **Initiatives:** "Should we change the Constitution to ban X?"
*   **Referendums:** "Do we accept the new law on Y that the Parliament just passed?"

### What we do NOT vote on (Federally):
*   **Radio/TV Programs (b):** This is handled by the SRG SSR (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation) under a legal mandate.
*   **Administrative Jobs (d):** Hiring for government offices is done through professional application processes, not elections.
*   **Party Programs (a):** While you might choose a party based on its program, you don't "vote on the program" itself at the ballot box.
