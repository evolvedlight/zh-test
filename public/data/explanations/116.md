# 🗳️ Electing the Cantonsrat

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Members of the Zurich Cantonsrat (Parliament) are determined **through elections**.

### Democratic Representation
The Cantonsrat is the legislative branch of the canton.
*   **Size:** 180 seats.
*   **The Voters:** Only Swiss citizens living in the Canton of Zurich who are 18 or older can vote.
*   **The System:** Proportional representation. The canton is divided into electoral districts (Wahlkreise). Each district gets a number of seats based on its population.

### Why not the other options?
In a democracy, the parliament represents the people. If the government (Regierungsrat) could appoint the parliament (b), there would be no separation of powers. The federal parliament (c) and the Council of States (d) are separate levels of government and do not interfere with the internal organization of the cantonal legislative.
