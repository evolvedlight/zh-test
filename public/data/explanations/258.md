# 🏔️ Crossing the Alps: Mountain Passes

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Simplon, Gotthard, and Grosser Sankt Bernhard are examples of **Swiss Alpine Passes** (Alpenpässe).

### Strategic Importance
Passes are the lowest navigable points on a mountain range. Historically, they were the only way to travel and trade between Northern and Southern Europe.
*   **Gotthard:** The most important north-south connection in the Swiss Alps.
*   **Simplon:** Connects the Valais with Italy.
*   **Grosser Sankt Bernhard:** Famous for its hospice and the St. Bernard rescue dogs.

### Modern Times
While most traffic today goes through massive tunnels *under* the mountains (like the Gotthard and Seelisberg tunnels), the passes remain vital for:
1.  **Tourism:** Thousands of people drive or cycle over the passes in the summer to enjoy the spectacular views.
2.  **Redundancy:** They serve as backup routes when tunnels are closed for maintenance or due to accidents.
3.  **Winter Closure:** Many high-altitude passes are closed during the winter months due to heavy snow and avalanche risk.
