# 🏥 Insuring Your Newborn

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: A child must be registered for health insurance **at the latest three months after birth**.

### The Rules
*   **Retroactive Coverage:** If you register the child within the first three months, the coverage is retroactive to the day of birth. This means all costs from the hospital stay and the first check-ups are covered.
*   **Choice:** Parents can choose any health insurance company for their child. It does not have to be the same company the parents use.
*   **No Rejection:** The insurance company *must* accept the child for basic insurance, regardless of their health at birth.

### Why three months?
This gives parents enough time after the birth to compare offers and select a model (e.g., HMO or Telmed) that fits their needs.
