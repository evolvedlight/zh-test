# 🗳️ The 4-Year Legislative Cycle

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Members of the Zurich Cantonsrat (Parliament) are elected every **4 years**.

### The Legislative Period
This four-year cycle is common in most Swiss cantons and at the federal level.
*   **The Election:** The election for the 180 seats of the Cantonsrat takes place on the same day as the election for the 7 members of the Regierungsrat.
*   **Proportional Representation:** The seats are distributed among political parties according to the "Double Pukelsheim" method, which ensures that both the party's strength across the whole canton and its strength in individual districts are considered fairly.
*   **Accountability:** Regular elections allow the citizens of Zurich to reward or punish parties for their performance in the previous four years.
