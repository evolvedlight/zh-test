# ⚖️ Abortion Rights: The "Fristenlösung"

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The "Fristenlösung" (Time-limit rule) means that a woman can **decide freely on an abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy**.

### The Law
Since a popular vote in **2002**, abortion has been legal in Switzerland under specific conditions:
1.  **Period:** Within the first 12 weeks after the start of the last menstrual period.
2.  **Consent:** The woman must state in writing that she is in a situation of distress (Notlage).
3.  **Counseling:** The doctor must provide her with information and counseling.

### After 12 Weeks
After the first 12 weeks, an abortion is only legal if a doctor determines that it is necessary to prevent "serious physical injury or profound psychological distress" for the woman.
*   **Self-determination:** The law emphasizes the woman's right to decide for herself. No permission from a husband (b), parents (for those over 16), or a court is needed.
*   **Payment:** The mandatory basic health insurance (KVG) covers the costs of the procedure.
