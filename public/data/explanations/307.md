# 🎭 The Morgestraich in Basel

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: At 4 AM on the Monday of Carnival (Fasnacht) in Basel, **all street lights are switched off, and the pipers and drummers begin to play**.

### The Ritual
The "Morgestraich" is the magical start of the **Basler Fasnacht**, the largest carnival in Switzerland.
*   **Lights Out:** At the command "Morgestraich, vorwärts marsch!" (Morgestraich, forward march!), the city goes completely dark.
*   **Lanterns:** The only light comes from hundreds of large, hand-painted lanterns carried by the carnival groups (Cliques), depicting satirical themes from the past year.
*   **Music:** Thousands of people play the same melody on piccolos and drums in perfect harmony.
*   **Duration:** The carnival lasts exactly 72 hours, known as the "three most beautiful days" (die drey scheenschte Dääg).

The Basler Fasnacht is recognized by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity because of its unique blend of music, craft, and political satire.
