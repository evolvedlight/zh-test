# 🙏 Freedom of Belief and Conscience

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **freedom of belief and conscience** (Glaubens- und Gewissensfreiheit) is a fundamental right anchored in the Federal Constitution.

### What it Guarantees
*   **Freedom to Choose:** You can choose your own religion or philosophical conviction freely.
*   **Freedom to Practice:** You can practice your faith (e.g., praying, attending services) without interference from the state.
*   **Freedom NOT to believe:** You have the right not to belong to any religion and not to be forced to attend religious services.

### Equality of Religions
The state must treat all religions equally. While some cantons have "State Churches" (Landeskirchen) that receive specific taxes, this does not limit the rights of members of other faiths (Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, etc.) to practice their religion freely.
