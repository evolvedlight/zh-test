# 🚗 Loss of Driving License

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Your driving license (Fahrausweis) can be revoked if you **drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs**.

### Road Safety (Via Sicura)
Switzerland has very strict "Via Sicura" laws to prevent traffic accidents.
*   **Alcohol:** The limit is **0.5 permille** (0.25 mg/l). For new drivers (in the 3-year probation period) and professional drivers, the limit is **0.1 permille** (basically zero tolerance).
*   **Drugs:** Any detectable amount of illegal drugs (like cannabis, cocaine, or ecstasy) in the blood while driving is forbidden.
*   **Speeding:** Exceeding the speed limit by a large amount (e.g., +40 km/h in a 30 km/h zone) leads to an immediate loss of the license and potentially a prison sentence.

### Consequences
If your license is revoked, the "Strassenverkehrsamt" decides for how long (from 1 month to life). You might also have to undergo a psychological test (Verkehrspsychologische Untersuchung) to prove you are fit to drive again.
*   **Other options:** While bad parking (c) or unnecessary noise (a) can lead to a fine (Busse), they do not usually lead to the loss of your license.
