# 🍟 The Röstigraben: Cultural Divide

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The "Röstigraben" is the **cultural boundary between German-speaking and French-speaking Switzerland**.

### Meaning and Origin
*   **Name:** "Rösti" is a traditional German-Swiss potato dish. "Graben" means ditch or trench.
*   **Geography:** It roughly follows the Saane/Sarine river in the cantons of Fribourg and Bern.
*   **Politics:** It is often visible in national votes. The French-speaking part (Romandie) often votes differently than the German-speaking part, especially on issues like foreign policy (EU) or social spending.
*   **Culture:** It reflects different attitudes towards the role of the state, lifestyle, and work-life balance.

### Symbolism
While the term started as a joke, it is a serious concept in Swiss politics. The state works hard to bridge this "ditch" through compromise and by ensuring that the interests of the French-speaking minority are respected by the German-speaking majority.
*   **Other options:** The term has nothing to do with the Rhone (b), Aare (c), or the border with Germany (d).
