# 🇨🇭 The Modern Canton Zurich: 1803

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Canton of Zurich in its modern sense has existed since **1803**.

### The Mediation Act
While Zurich joined the Swiss Confederacy much earlier (1351), the "modern" canton was defined during the Napoleonic era.
*   **1798:** Napoleon established the centralized "Helvetic Republic" (d), where cantons were just administrative districts without power.
*   **1803:** Realizing the centralized model failed, Napoleon issued the **Act of Mediation**.
*   **Restoration of Sovereignty:** This act restored the cantons' sovereignty and fixed their modern borders. For Zurich, this meant it became a semi-autonomous state within the Swiss Confederacy once again, with the territory and structure that largely persist today.
*   **1848 (Federal State):** Later, the 1848 Constitution (b) integrated Zurich into the modern federal state, but the basic identity of the "Canton" was shaped by the events of 1803.
