# 💼 Unions: Protecting Workers

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: **Trade Unions** (Gewerkschaften) are the organizations that advocate for the rights and interests of employees.

### Key Tasks
1.  **Negotiation:** They negotiate **Collective Labor Agreements** (GAV - Gesamtarbeitsverträge) with employers' associations. These agreements set minimum wages, working hours, and holiday entitlements for whole industries (like construction, retail, or hospitality).
2.  **Protection:** They support individual members in legal disputes with their bosses (e.g., in cases of unfair dismissal).
3.  **Politics:** They lobby the government and parliament for better labor laws and social security.

### Partnership
In Switzerland, unions and employers usually follow the principle of **"Social Partnership"** (Sozialpartnerschaft). This means they try to find compromises through negotiation rather than going on strike immediately. This leads to a very stable labor market with very few strikes compared to other European countries.
