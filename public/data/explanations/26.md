# 🗳️ Legislative Power: Nationalrat, Ständerat, & The People

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: On the federal level, new laws are decided by the **National Council, the Council of States, and the People (through Referendum)**.

### The Legislative Process
1.  **Preparation:** The Federal Council (Executive) drafts a bill based on suggestions (motion/postulate) or expert reports.
2.  **Consultation (Vernehmlassung):** Cantons, parties, and associations give feedback.
3.  **Parliamentary Debate:** The **National Council** (200 seats) and **Council of States** (46 seats) debate the bill separately. Both must agree on the wording.
4.  **Referendum:** If 50,000 citizens sign a petition within 100 days, the law goes to a **popular vote**.

### Why is this Unique?
In most countries (like Germany or the UK), the Parliament has the final say. In Switzerland, the people have a **veto right** (referendum).
