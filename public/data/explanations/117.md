# 🗳️ The Gemeindeversammlung: Direct Democracy in Action

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: At a "Gemeindeversammlung" (Municipal Assembly), the **eligible voters decide on the budget and other local matters**.

### How it Works
In many smaller and medium-sized municipalities in the Canton of Zurich, there is no local parliament. Instead, the "Legislative" is the assembly of all eligible citizens.
*   **Participation:** Any Swiss citizen living in the municipality can attend.
*   **Powers:** They vote on the annual budget, the local tax rate, large construction projects (like a new school), and changes to local regulations.
*   **Discussion:** Unlike at the ballot box, people can ask questions and debate the topics before voting by a show of hands.

### City of Zurich vs. Smaller Towns
The City of Zurich is too large for an assembly. It has a local parliament (Gemeinderat). But in most of the other 150+ municipalities in the canton, the "Gemeindeversammlung" is the highest political authority.
