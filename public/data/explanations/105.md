# 📝 Political Voice without a Passport: The Petition

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: In the Canton of Zurich, people without a Swiss passport can be politically active by submitting a **petition**.

### What is a Petition?
A petition is a formal request or complaint addressed to an authority (like the Cantonsrat or the Regierungsrat).
*   **Universal Right:** Article 33 of the Federal Constitution states that *any person* (regardless of age, nationality, or residence status) has the right to submit a petition without being disadvantaged.
*   **Response:** The authority is obliged to take note of the petition, but they are not legally required to follow its suggestions.

### Other Political Acts
*   **Referendum/Initiative (a):** These require the right to vote, which is tied to citizenship in Zurich.
*   **Government/Commission (c, d):** Holding office or being in a parliamentary commission also requires Swiss citizenship in Zurich.

### Why it Matters
Petitions allow residents to bring local problems (like a dangerous intersection or a need for a park) to the attention of politicians.
