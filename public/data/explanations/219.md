# 🌍 Refugees from (Ex-)Yugoslavia

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In the 1990s, many people came from Ex-Yugoslavia to Switzerland because they were **fleeing from war in their homeland**.

### The Yugoslav Wars
The collapse of the socialist federal republic of Yugoslavia led to several brutal wars (e.g., in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo).
*   **Humanitarian Tradition:** Switzerland accepted tens of thousands of refugees, especially from Bosnia and later from Kosovo. At one point, the Bosnian community in Switzerland was one of the largest in Europe relative to the population.
*   **Settlement:** While many returned after the wars, many others stayed and integrated into Swiss society.
*   **Impact:** Today, people from the Western Balkans (Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia, North Macedonia) form one of the largest foreign communities in Switzerland and are a significant part of the workforce and the national sports teams.
