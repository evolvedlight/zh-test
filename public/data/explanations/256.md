### Swiss Chocolate History
In the 19th century, Swiss inventors revolutionized how chocolate was made, turning it from a bitter drink into the smooth, melting bars we know today.
*   **Philippe Suchard:** Founded a factory in Neuchâtel in 1826 (famous for Milka).
*   **Rudolph Lindt:** A Zurich-born confectioner who invented the "Conching" machine in 1879. This process removed the grittiness and allowed the chocolate to melt on the tongue.
*   **Expansion:** Lindt's business was eventually bought by the Zurich-based company **Sprüngli**, creating the world-famous "Lindt & Sprüngli" brand headquartered in Kilchberg, Zurich.

### Global Reputation
Thanks to pioneers like Lindt, Suchard, and Nestlé (who invented milk chocolate), Switzerland became the world's most famous nation for high-quality chocolate, an industry that remains an important part of the Swiss economy and identity today.
