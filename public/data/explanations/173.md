The correct answer is **(b)**: A Berufsbildungszentrum (Vocational Training Center) is a **location where various offers contribute to vocational education**.

### Dual Education System
Switzerland is famous for its "Dual Education."
*   **Apprenticeship (Lehre):** Young people work 3-4 days a week in a company and attend a vocational school for 1-2 days.
*   **The School:** The "Berufsbildungszentrum" (or "Berufsschule") is that school. It provides the theoretical knowledge for the job (e.g., math for a carpenter, accounting for a clerk).
*   **Variety:** These centers often offer courses for many different professions under one roof and also provide "Berufsmaturität" (Vocational Baccalaureate) which allows students to go to a University of Applied Sciences (Fachhochschule).

This system is a key reason for Switzerland's low youth unemployment, as it ensures young people have exactly the skills the economy needs.
