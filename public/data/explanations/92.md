# ⚖️ Consequences of Committing a Crime

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In Switzerland, **anyone who violates a law will be punished** according to the rules of the Criminal Code.

### The Rule of Law
*   **State Monopoly on Force:** Private revenge (b) is strictly forbidden. The state is the only authority allowed to punish wrongdoers.
*   **Uniform Punishment:** The law defines which act is a crime and what the range of punishment is. Victims (d) cannot choose the punishment; that is the job of the **Judge**.
*   **Self-Reporting (c):** While turning oneself in (Selbstanzeige) might lead to a milder sentence (Strafmilderung), it does not automatically make one "exempt from punishment."

### Why it Matters
This system ensures that justice is impartial and based on pre-defined rules, rather than personal feelings or the social status of the people involved. It provides security and predictability in society.
