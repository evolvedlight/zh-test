# 🏫 Local Tasks: Primary Schools

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: One of the primary tasks of the municipalities in Zurich is to **organize the primary schools** (Primarschule).

### Local Education
While the Canton sets the curriculum and rules, the local municipality is responsible for:
*   **Infrastructure:** Building and maintaining school buildings.
*   **Staff:** Hiring teachers and school staff.
*   **Support:** Organizing school transport, lunches, and after-school care.

### Why not the other levels?
*   **Autobahnen (a):** These are national (Bund) or cantonal (Canton) roads.
*   **Militär (b):** This is exclusively a federal (Bund) task.
*   **Insurance (c):** Providing insurance is a private business or handled by national social security systems (like AHV).
*   **Secondary/Higher Ed:** Is usually managed at the cantonal level.
