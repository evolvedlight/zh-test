# 🏫 Funding the Schools

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Canton and the Municipalities** share the responsibility for the financing and organization of the primary school (Primarschule).

### The Division of Tasks
1.  **The Canton:** Sets the "Lehrplan" (curriculum), pays the majority of the teachers' salaries, and supervises the quality of education across the whole region.
2.  **The Municipality:** Is responsible for the "hardware": buildings, furniture, materials, and school transport. They also hire the teachers and manage the local school administration.

### Free of Charge
Because the state (Canton and Municipality) pays for the schools through taxes, primary education is **free of charge** for all children. This ensures that every child, regardless of their parents' financial situation, has the same opportunity for a good education.
*   **The Bund (c):** Only provides the general framework but does not fund or run local schools.
*   **Parents (a):** Only pay for voluntary extras, like school lunches or private lessons.
