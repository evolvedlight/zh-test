# 🇨🇭 The Executive Branch: The Federal Council

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **Federal Council** (Bundesrat) leads the government business of Switzerland.

### How it Works
*   **7 Members:** The "Magic Formula" distributes seats among the main parties (2 SVP, 2 SP, 2 FDP, 1 Mitte).
*   **Departments:** Each Councillor heads one of the 7 Departments (Ministries), such as Finance, Foreign Affairs, or Environment.
*   **Collegiality:** They discuss issues in secret weekly meetings and must support the *collective decision* publicly, even if they personally disagree.
*   **Rotating Presidency:** The position of **President of the Confederation** rotates annually among the members, ensuring equality.

### Why not a President or Prime Minister?
This system prevents one person from holding too much power. Decisions are made by **consensus**, which leads to stability (but sometimes slow progress).
