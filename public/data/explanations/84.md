# 🔐 Data Privacy and Personal Rights

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Privacy or data protection is violated when **private information about an individual is published without a legal basis or without the person's consent**.

### The "Right to One's Own Image"
In Switzerland, every person has a right to their privacy (Privatsphäre).
*   **Photos:** You cannot just take a photo of a single person in the street and publish it on social media without their permission.
*   **Personal Data:** Companies and the state must protect your data (address, health records, financial info). They can only use it for the specific purpose for which it was collected.

### What is usually NOT a violation:
*   **General Street Photos (b):** Photos of crowds or general city views where no single person is the main subject are usually okay.
*   **News Reporting (c):** Reporting on public figures or events of public interest is allowed, as long as it respects the person's core dignity and doesn't spread lies.
