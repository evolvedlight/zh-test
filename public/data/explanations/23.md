# 🗳️ Why Regular Elections are Vital

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Regular elections are held so that **the people can determine their representation** (Volksvertretung bestimmen kann).

### Why Every 4 Years?
*   **Accountability:** If a representative or party does not fulfill their promises or makes bad decisions, the voters can replace them in the next election.
*   **New Issues:** Society changes (e.g., climate change, digitalization). New parties or candidates with fresh ideas can enter parliament to address these topics.
*   **Preventing Dictatorship:** Regular turnover of power prevents any single person or group from accumulating too much control indefinitely.

### Swiss Context
The **Federal Elections** (Nationalratswahlen & Ständeratswahlen) take place every four years on the penultimate Sunday of October (e.g., 2023, 2027). This date is fixed by law, ensuring stability and predictability.
