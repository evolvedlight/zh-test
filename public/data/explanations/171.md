# 📄 Contents of an Employment Contract

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: An employment contract (Arbeitsvertrag) regulates, among other things, **the amount of the salary**.

### Key Elements of the Contract
A standard contract covers:
1.  **Function:** Your job title and main tasks.
2.  **Working Hours:** How many hours per week (e.g., 40 or 42 hours).
3.  **Salary:** Your gross salary before taxes and social deductions.
4.  **Holidays:** At least 4 weeks per year are mandatory by law (many companies offer 5).
5.  **Notice Period:** How long in advance you or the boss must tell the other if the job is ending.

### What is NOT in the contract:
*   **Health Insurance (a):** This is your private responsibility; you choose and pay for it yourself.
*   **Old-Age Pension (b):** The amount of your AHV pension is decided by federal law, not your boss.
*   **Free Time (c):** What you do after work is your private business (as long as it doesn't harm the company's reputation).
