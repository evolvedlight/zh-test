# 💼 Help with Labor Law

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: For questions about labor law, employees can turn to **lawyers, unions, and labor courts**.

### Where to get Advice?
1.  **Unions (Gewerkschaften):** Often the first stop for members. They have experts who know the specific rules of your industry.
2.  **Legal Protection Insurance:** Many people in Switzerland have "Rechtsschutzversicherung" which pays for a lawyer.
3.  **Conciliation Authorities (Schlichtungsbehörden):** Before you go to court, you must usually go to a "Schlichtungsverfahren" which is free and tries to find a compromise between you and your boss.
4.  **Free Legal Advice:** Some municipalities or the Zurich Bar Association (Zürcher Anwaltsverband) offer short, free advice sessions.

The tax office (b), police (c), or church (d) do not have the expertise or jurisdiction to handle disputes about your work contract.
