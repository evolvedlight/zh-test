# 🏛️ Seven Members of the Government

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The government of the Canton of Zurich (Regierungsrat) has **7 members**.

### Continuity of the Number 7
This number matches the number of members in the Swiss Federal Council. Having 7 members ensures:
1.  **Workload Distribution:** Each member can head a significant department (Direktion).
2.  **Diverse Perspectives:** Multiple parties can be represented, following the principle of "Concordance" (all major parties share responsibility).
3.  **Stability:** It is a small enough group to make efficient decisions but large enough to represent the diversity of the canton's interests.

### Election
The members are elected directly by the people for a four-year term. If a seat becomes vacant mid-term, a "By-election" (Ersatzwahl) is held.
