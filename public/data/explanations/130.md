# 🏥 Mandatory Health Insurance

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **obligatory health insurance (OKP/Grundversicherung)** is mandatory for everyone living in Switzerland.

### Basic Insurance (KVG)
*   **Mandatory:** You must sign up within 3 months of arriving or birth.
*   **Uniform Benefits:** All insurance companies must offer exactly the same benefits in the basic package. They cannot refuse anyone, regardless of age or pre-existing conditions.
*   **Coverage:** Includes doctor visits, hospital stays in a general ward, medications, and basic maternity care.

### Voluntary Options
*   **Zusatzversicherungen (c):** These are voluntary "Top-up" insurances for things like dental care (b), private rooms in hospitals, or alternative medicine (a). Insurance companies *can* reject you for these based on your health history.
