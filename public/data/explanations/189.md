# 💍 Marriage Restrictions: Family Ties

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: A prerequisite for marriage in Switzerland is that the **partners must not be closely related**.

### Prohibited Relationships
To prevent biological issues and protect family structures, the ZGB (Art. 95) forbids marriage between:
*   **Direct Line:** Parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren.
*   **Siblings:** Brothers and sisters (including half-siblings).
*   **Adoption:** Marriage between an adoptive parent and an adopted child is also forbidden as long as the adoption relationship exists.

### Other Options
*   **Age (a):** The minimum age is **18**, not 16.
*   **Registered Partnership (b):** You don't need to be in a partnership first; you can marry directly.
*   **Residence (c):** Partners do not have to live together before marrying (though most do).
*   **Same-Sex Marriage:** Since July 2022 ("Ehe für alle"), two men or two women can marry under exactly the same conditions as a man and a woman.
