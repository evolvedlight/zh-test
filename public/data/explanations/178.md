# 🇪🇺 Switzerland's Main Trading Partner: The EU

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **European Union (EU)** is Switzerland's most important trading partner.

### Economic Ties
Even though Switzerland is not a member of the EU, its economy is deeply integrated with it.
*   **Exports:** Over 50% of Swiss exports (like watches, chemicals, and machinery) go to EU countries (especially Germany, France, and Italy).
*   **Imports:** Over 60% of everything Switzerland buys from abroad comes from the EU.
*   **Bilateral Agreements:** These treaties allow Swiss companies to access the European single market easily.

### Comparison
While the USA (b) and China (c) are also very important, the proximity and the long history of cooperation make the EU the dominant partner. This is why the "Bilateral Path" (Bilaterale Weg) is a central topic in Swiss foreign policy.
