# 🌍 The Era of Emigration

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Many Swiss people emigrated in the 19th century because of **hunger, poverty, and unemployment**.

### When Switzerland was Poor
Today we think of Switzerland as a wealthy country, but in the 1800s, it was a different story.
*   **Famines:** Several bad harvests (like in 1816/17 and the "Potato Blight" in the 1840s) led to widespread starvation.
*   **Population Growth:** The population grew faster than the food supply.
*   **Economic Change:** The transition from hand-weaving to machines in factories made many traditional craftsmen unemployed.
*   **Destinations:** Hundreds of thousands of Swiss left for North and South America. They founded towns like "New Bern" or "New Glarus" in the USA.

### Significance
This period reminds us that Switzerland's prosperity is a relatively recent achievement and that the country itself was once a source of economic refugees.
