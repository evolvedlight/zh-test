# 🪖 Compulsory Service

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: **Young men with Swiss citizenship** are required to perform military service (Militärdienst) or civil defense service (Zivilschutzdienst).

### The "Miliz" System
Switzerland does not have a professional army of the same scale as other countries; it relies on its citizens.
*   **Recruitment:** Men are drafted at the age of 19.
*   **Service:** Most serve in the Army. Those who have a conflict of conscience can apply for **Civilian Service** (Zivildienst), which involves working in social, environmental, or medical institutions (usually for 1.5 times the length of military service).
*   **Zivilschutz:** Those who are not fit for the army but still able to work serve in Civil Protection (disaster relief).
*   **Women:** Military service is **voluntary** for Swiss women, but they are increasingly joining.

### The Military Tax
Swiss men who do not perform military or civilian service must pay a "Military Service Exemption Tax" (Wehrpflichtersatzabgabe) until they are around 30 years old.
