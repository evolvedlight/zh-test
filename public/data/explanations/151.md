# 🏥 Social Security: The IV

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Invalidenversicherung (IV)** is a social insurance in Switzerland.

### What it Does
The IV is part of the "1st Pillar" of social security. It supports people who have become partially or fully unable to work due to physical, mental, or psychological health problems.
*   **Principle:** "Integration before Pension." The first goal of the IV is to help the person return to the workforce through retraining or workplace adjustments.
*   **Pension:** If integration is not possible, the IV pays a monthly pension to ensure a basic standard of living.

### Other Options
The other options (a, c, d) are forms of **private insurance**. While they are common, they are not part of the state-mandated social security system designed to prevent poverty and ensure social stability.
