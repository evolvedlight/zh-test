# 🗳️ The "Schwarzenbach Initiative" (1970)

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The Schwarzenbach Initiative in 1970 called for **limiting the number of foreigners in Switzerland**.

### The "Überfremdung" Debate
In the 1950s and 60s, Switzerland brought in many "guest workers" (mostly from Italy) to work in the growing industry and construction sectors.
*   **The Initiative:** James Schwarzenbach, a right-wing politician, launched an initiative to limit the foreign population to 10% in most cantons.
*   **The Vote:** The campaign was very emotional and polarized the country. In 1970, the initiative was **rejected** by 54% of the voters, but the high "Yes" share (46%) forced the government to introduce stricter immigration quotas.
*   **Significance:** This event showed the tension between the economic need for foreign labor and the cultural fears of some parts of the population. It was the first of many votes on "over-foreignization" (Überfremdung) in modern Swiss history.
