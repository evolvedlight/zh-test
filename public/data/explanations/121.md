# 🗺️ Local Planning: Raumplanung

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Municipalities are responsible for **local spatial planning** (lokale Raumplanung).

### Zoning Laws
Every municipality has a **Zoning Plan (Zonenplan)** that decides how the land can be used:
*   **Residential Zones:** Where people can live.
*   **Commercial/Industrial Zones:** Where factories and offices are built.
*   **Public Zones:** For schools, hospitals, or parks.
*   **Agricultural Zones:** To protect farmland.

### Autonomy
This is a key part of "Municipal Autonomy." The people living in the village or city decide through their local parliament or assembly how their environment should develop. The Bund (b, d) handles big-picture national issues, and the Canton coordinates between the municipalities, but the detailed planning is local.
