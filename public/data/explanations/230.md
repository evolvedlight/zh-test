# 🇨🇭 Marignano 1515: The End of Swiss Expansion

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: After losing the Battle of Marignano in 1515, the Confederates **gave up on conquering further territories**.

### The Battle
At Marignano (near Milan, Italy), the Swiss "Reisläufer" (mercenaries), who were feared throughout Europe for their military prowess, faced the French army.
*   **The Defeat:** For the first time, the Swiss were decisively beaten, mainly by the modern artillery of the French King Francis I.
*   **Neutrality Roots:** While not "official neutrality" yet, this defeat marked the turning point in Swiss foreign policy. The cantons realized they were too small to compete with the rising great powers of Europe (France, Spain, Austria).
*   **The Treaty:** They signed a "Perpetual Peace" with France in 1516. From then on, Switzerland focused on internal development and acting as a provider of mercenaries for *others*, rather than pursuing its own imperial ambitions.

This pragmatic retreat from European power politics is often seen as the historical beginning of the Swiss path towards permanent neutrality.
