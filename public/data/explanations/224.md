# 📈 The Golden Age: The 1960s

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The standard of living for many people in Switzerland rose significantly in the **1960s**.

### The "Hochkonjunktur"
The decades following World War II (especially the 1950s and 60s) were a period of unprecedented economic growth in Switzerland.
*   **Wages:** Real wages grew rapidly, giving families more "disposable income."
*   **Consumption:** For the first time, mass consumption became possible. Things like cars, washing machines, televisions, and foreign vacations became accessible to the middle and working classes.
*   **Housing:** Modern apartment blocks were built with better heating and plumbing.
*   **Social Safety:** The AHV (retirement pension) was expanded, providing more security for old age.
*   **Optimism:** This era was characterized by a strong belief in progress and technology.

This period fundamentally shaped the modern Swiss "Affluent Society," but it also led to cultural tensions (like the youth protests of 1968) as people began to question the focus on material wealth.
