# 🌲 Adapting Forests to Climate Change

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Foresters react to rising temperatures by **planting different tree species**.

### The Future of the Forest
As the climate warms, traditional Swiss tree species like the **Spruce** (Fichte/Rottanne) are struggling. They suffer from drought and are easily attacked by bark beetles in the heat.
*   **Adaptation:** Foresters are diversifying the forests to make them more resilient (climate-adapted forest).
*   **New Species:** They are planting trees that can handle heat and drought better, such as the **Oak** (Eiche), **Douglas Fir**, or **Linden**.
*   **Protection:** Healthy forests are vital for Switzerland because they protect mountain towns from avalanches and landslides.

### Why not the other options?
Deforesting (a) would be a disaster for the environment and protection against natural hazards. Spraying forests (c) is not a practical or sustainable solution for large areas. Foresters are working harder than ever to manage this transition (d).
