# 🏭 From Farms to Factories

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: In the 19th century, Switzerland transformed **from an agrarian state to an industrial state**.

### A Radical Change
At the beginning of the 1800s, most Swiss people were farmers living in small, isolated villages.
*   **Industrialization:** Driven by the textile, machine, and chemical industries, people moved from the countryside to the cities (especially Zurich and Winterthur).
*   **Infrastructure:** The creation of the Federal State in 1848 allowed for a unified market, a single currency (CHF), and the building of the national railway.
*   **Exports:** Because Switzerland is small and has few raw materials, it had to export high-quality industrial goods to survive.
*   **Society:** This shift created a new "working class" and led to the birth of modern social problems (poverty in cities) and solutions (unions and social security).

By 1900, Switzerland was one of the most industrialized countries in the world, with its population no longer primarily living off the land but through global trade and manufacturing.
