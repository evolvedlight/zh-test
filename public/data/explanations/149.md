# 👶 Family Support through Taxes

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The Swiss state supports families through **Tax Deductions** (Steuerabzüge).

### Lowering the Tax Load
Because raising children is expensive, the state allows parents to subtract certain amounts from their taxable income:
1.  **Child Deduction (Kinderabzug):** A fixed amount per child. This reduces the "taxable income," so you pay less tax.
2.  **Childcare Deduction (Fremdbetreuungsabzug):** If both parents work and pay for a crèche (Kita) or a nanny, they can deduct a significant portion of those costs from their taxes.
3.  **Insurance Deduction:** Parents can also deduct the health insurance premiums they pay for their children.

### Goal
The goal is to leave more "disposable income" in the pockets of families, allowing them to afford the costs of housing, food, and education for their children. This is a key part of the Swiss family policy, alongside direct payments like child allowances.
