### Long Journey to Social Security
The plan for a national pension system had been around for decades.
*   **1925:** A constitutional article for AHV was accepted, but the law to implement it was rejected by voters in 1931.
*   **WWII:** During the war, the "Income Compensation" (EO) for soldiers was very successful. This model was used to finally launch the AHV.
*   **The Vote:** In 1947, 80% of Swiss voters said "Yes" to the AHV law.
*   **1948:** The first AHV pensions were paid out on January 1st.

### Significance
The AHV is the "First Pillar" of the Swiss pension system and is based on solidarity between the generations. It is arguably the most important social achievement in modern Swiss history, as it significantly reduced poverty among the elderly.
