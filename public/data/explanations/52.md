# 🤝 The Task of the State: Social Security

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: A central task of the Swiss Federal State is to **ensure social security**.

### The Social Safety Net
The state manages various insurance systems to protect citizens from financial ruin due to old age, disability, or unemployment:
1.  **AHV (Old Age and Survivors Insurance):** The "1st pillar" of the pension system.
2.  **IV (Disability Insurance):** Supporting those who cannot work due to health issues.
3.  **ALV (Unemployment Insurance):** Providing income during job searches.
4.  **EO (Income Compensation):** For those in military service or on maternity/paternity leave.

### What the State does NOT do:
*   **Wages and Factories (b):** Switzerland has a liberal market economy. The state does not organize work in private factories.
*   **Housing for All (c):** While the state promotes affordable housing (e.g., via cooperatives), it does not "guarantee" a cheap apartment for everyone.
*   **Media (d):** The state does not publish its own newspapers; media must be private and independent.
