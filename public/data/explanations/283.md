# 💧 Water: Switzerland's Blue Gold

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A major natural resource of Switzerland is its **large water supplies for hydropower plants**.

### The Water Tower of Europe
Because of its high mountains and heavy rainfall/snow, Switzerland has a huge amount of water.
*   **Hydropower:** About **60%** of Switzerland's electricity is produced by hydropower (dams and run-of-river plants). This is one of the cleanest ways to generate power and a key advantage for the Swiss economy.
*   **Drinking Water:** Switzerland has excellent groundwater and spring water. In most places, tap water is of high quality and perfectly safe to drink.
*   **Rivers:** Major European rivers like the Rhine and Rhone start in the Swiss Alps.

### Other Resources
*   **Gold (a):** There is no significant gold mining in Switzerland (although Swiss banks trade a lot of it).
*   **Fossil Fuels (c):** Switzerland has almost no oil or coal deposits.
*   **Agriculture:** While it has good soil, water remains the most strategically important "raw material" of the country.
