# 🇨🇭 The Meaning of CH: Confoederatio Helvetica

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The abbreviation **CH** stands for **Confoederatio Helvetica**.

### Why Latin?
Switzerland has four national languages (German, French, Italian, Romansh). To avoid choosing one language over the others for official international purposes, Switzerland uses the **neutral Latin language**.
*   **Confoederatio:** Means "Confederation" or "Alliance."
*   **Helvetica:** Refers to the **Helvetii**, the Celtic tribe that lived in Switzerland in Roman times.

### Usage
You see the "CH" everywhere:
*   **Internet:** The top-level domain for Swiss websites (.ch).
*   **Vehicles:** The country sticker on cars.
*   **Currency:** The ISO code for the Swiss Franc (CHF).
*   **Post:** On international letters and packages.

This simple abbreviation is a powerful symbol of Swiss unity and its practical solution to the challenges of being a multilingual nation.
