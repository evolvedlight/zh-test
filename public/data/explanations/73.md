# 👮 The Role of the Police

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A central task of the police is to **prosecute legal violations** (Rechtsverletzungen verfolgen).

### Key Responsibilities
1.  **Prevention:** Patrolling and visibility to prevent crimes before they happen.
2.  **Safety:** Ensuring public order at events or in traffic.
3.  **Investigation:** Finding and arresting criminals and gathering evidence for the prosecutor (Staatsanwaltschaft).
4.  **Assistance:** Helping citizens in emergencies.

### Limits of Police Power
In a "Rechtsstaat" (State based on the rule of law), the police must follow the law themselves.
*   They cannot pass laws (c).
*   They cannot judge people or send them to prison (d); only a **Judge** can do that.
*   They must treat everyone with respect and only use force as a last resort.
