# ⚖️ The Prohibition of Torture

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Federal Constitution strictly prohibits **torture** and any other form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

### Human Dignity
This is a "non-derogable" right, meaning it can **never** be suspended, even in times of war or national emergency.
*   **Article 10:** "Every person has the right to physical and mental integrity. Torture and any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited."
*   **Significance:** This reflects Switzerland's commitment to international human rights (like the European Convention on Human Rights).

### Other Options
*   **Religious Symbols (a):** Wearing religious signs is generally allowed in public as part of religious freedom.
*   **Fundraising (b):** Collecting money for charity is allowed and even encouraged.
*   **Unpaid Work (d):** While "forced labor" is prohibited, voluntary work (Ehrenamt) is a very common and respected part of Swiss culture.
