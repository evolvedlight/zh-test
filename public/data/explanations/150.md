# 🏫 What do Taxes Pay For?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The state uses tax money to finance **schools** and education.

### Public Services
Taxes are the "membership fee" for living in a high-quality society. The state uses this money for things that benefit everyone but are too expensive for individuals to pay for alone:
1.  **Education:** Kindergarten, primary and secondary schools, vocational training, and universities.
2.  **Infrastructure:** Roads, railways, tunnels, and public buildings.
3.  **Security:** Police, the legal system, and the military.
4.  **Social Safety:** Subsidies for health insurance, help for the poor (Sozialhilfe), and support for families.

### Private vs. Public
Things like cinemas (b), hotels (d), and private doctor practices (a) are generally **private businesses**. They must make a profit from their customers and are not funded by the state. Schools, however, are a "public good" that should be accessible to every child regardless of their parents' income.
