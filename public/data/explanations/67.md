# ⚖️ The Monopoly on the Use of Force

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Only **the State (Police, Military)** is allowed to use physical force against people and property. This is called the **"Gewaltmonopol"** (Monopoly on Force).

### Why is this important?
In a modern democracy, "street justice" or "revenge" is forbidden. If everyone could use force to get what they want, society would collapse into chaos.
*   **Protection:** By giving the state the exclusive right to use force, we ensure that force is only used according to **laws** and **regulations**.
*   **Accountability:** If a police officer uses force, they are subject to strict legal review to ensure it was necessary and proportional.

### Self-Defense
The only exception is **Notwehr** (Self-Defense). You are allowed to use force to protect yourself or others from an immediate, illegal attack, but only as much as is absolutely necessary to stop the danger.
