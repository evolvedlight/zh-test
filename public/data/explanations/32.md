# 🗳️ The Target of a Referendum

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: A referendum is directed against **bills (laws) passed by the National Council and Council of States**.

### What CANNOT be challenged?
*   **Federal Council Decisions (a):** The day-to-day administrative decisions of the government are not subject to referendums.
*   **Court Rulings (b):** The judiciary (Federal Court) is independent. Its verdicts cannot be overturned by a popular vote.
*   **Administrative Measures (d):** General actions of the civil service are managed through the legal system and political oversight, not the ballot box.

### The "Brake" on Parliament
The referendum is specifically designed to give the people the "final say" on legislative work. It ensures that the Parliament does not pass laws that a majority of the population rejects. This creates a "Power Sharing" system where the legislature must seek broad consensus to avoid being "stopped" by a referendum.
