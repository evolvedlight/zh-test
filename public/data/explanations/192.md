# 🐶 Duties of a Dog Owner

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Dog owners in Switzerland must pay **dog taxes** (Hundesteuer).

### Responsibilities
Owning a dog in Switzerland involves several legal duties:
1.  **Taxation:** An annual tax is paid to the municipality or canton. In Zurich, this money is used for things like "Robidog" bins (for dog waste) and managing public spaces.
2.  **AMICUS Database:** Every dog must be chipped and registered in the national database "AMICUS."
3.  **Liability:** While not always mandatory by federal law, most cantons (including Zurich) require dog owners to have **Liability Insurance** (Haftpflichtversicherung) to cover potential damage caused by the dog.
4.  **Registration:** You must report the dog to your local municipality (Einwohnerkontrolle).

### Training
Until recently, mandatory dog courses (SKN) were required. While the federal requirement was abolished, some cantons still have their own rules for "large or potentially dangerous" breeds.
*   **Other options:** Health insurance (d) for pets is popular but voluntary.
