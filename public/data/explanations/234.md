# 🇨🇭 The Congress of Vienna 1815

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the European powers recognized and guaranteed Switzerland's **permanent neutrality**.

### Restoring Europe
After the final defeat of Napoleon, the great powers (Britain, Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France) met in Vienna to redraw the map of Europe.
1.  **Neutrality:** They agreed that a neutral, independent Switzerland at the center of Europe was essential for the continent's stability. They promised never to invade Switzerland as long as it didn't take sides in wars.
2.  **Borders:** They established the 22 cantons (adding Valais, Neuchâtel, and Geneva) and fixed the national borders that exist almost exactly the same today.
3.  **Independence:** Switzerland was officially recognized as a fully sovereign state, independent of the Holy Roman Empire.

This international recognition is the legal foundation of modern Swiss "armed neutrality."
