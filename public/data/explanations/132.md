# 🪖 Alternative to Military: Zivildienst

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Civilian Service (Zivildienst) is an **alternative to military service**.

### How it Works
*   **Who:** Only Swiss men who are "fit for military service" but cannot serve in the army for reasons of **conscience** (Gewissensgründe) can do Zivildienst.
*   **Length:** It lasts **1.5 times longer** than the military service.
*   **Tasks:** Participants work in public-interest institutions, such as hospitals, elderly care homes, environmental protection projects, or agricultural farms.

### Not to be confused with:
*   **Zivilschutz (Civil Protection):** For those who are not fit for the army but are fit for disaster relief.
*   **Voluntary Work (b):** Zivildienst is a legal obligation for those who choose it over the army; it is not "voluntary" in the sense of a hobby.
*   **Women (a):** Military and Civilian service are currently only mandatory for men.
