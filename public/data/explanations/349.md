# 🛡️ The Guilds and Sechseläuten

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **Guilds** (Zünfte) play a central role in Zurich's spring festival, the Sechseläuten.

### Historical Power
*   **What are Guilds?** Historically, they were associations of craftsmen and merchants (e.g., bakers, smiths, cloth merchants). In the Middle Ages and early modern period, the guilds governed the City of Zurich.
*   **Today:** The political power of the guilds was abolished in the 19th century, but they remain very important as **cultural and social associations**.
*   **The Festival:** At Sechseläuten, the 26 guilds of Zurich (with around 3,500 members) dress in their traditional costumes and parade through the city on foot and on horseback.
*   **The Culmination:** They lead the ceremony where the "Böögg" (winter symbol) is burned on the Sechseläutenplatz at 6 PM.

The guilds preserve Zurich's history and traditions, and their guild houses (Zunfthäuser) are some of the most beautiful historic buildings in the city center.
