# 🎯 The Role of Political Parties

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A political party is an **association of people with similar political goals and values**. They aim to influence the formation of political will and participate in elections.

### Major Parties in Switzerland
Switzerland has a **multi-party system**, meaning no single party governs alone. The four largest parties currently represented in the Federal Council are:
1.  **SVP (Swiss People's Party):** Focuses on independence and restrictive immigration.
2.  **SP (Social Democratic Party):** Focuses on social justice and public services.
3.  **FDP (The Liberals):** Focuses on individual liberty and a strong economy.
4.  **Die Mitte (The Centre):** Focuses on family values and compromise.

### The "Zauberformel" (Magic Formula)
This informal agreement allocates the 7 Federal Council seats among the largest parties based on their electoral strength, ensuring stability and consensus (concordance democracy).
