# 🗣️ The Fourth Language: Romansh

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The fourth national language of Switzerland is **Romansh** (Rätoromanisch).

### What is Romansh?
It is a Rhaeto-Romance language descended from the spoken Latin of the Roman Empire, mixed with local prehistoric and Celtic languages.
*   **Location:** It is spoken almost exclusively in the **Canton of Graubünden**.
*   **Variants:** There are five different dialects (idioms), but "Rumantsch Grischun" was created as a unified written language.

### Recognition
Romansh was recognized as a national language in **1938** after a popular vote (92% "Yes"). This was a strong signal of Swiss identity against the fascist ideologies of the time in neighboring countries. Since 1996, it has been a "partially official" language of the Confederation for communication with Romansh speakers.
