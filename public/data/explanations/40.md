# 🇨🇭 The Federal Executive: The Federal Council

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: On the federal level, the executive branch (the government) is called the **Bundesrat (Federal Council)**.

### The Three Powers
*   **Legislative (Parliament):** The Federal Assembly (National Council + Council of States).
*   **Executive (Government):** The **Federal Council**.
*   **Judiciary (Courts):** The Federal Supreme Court.

### Names at Different Levels
In Switzerland, names change depending on the level of government:
*   **Federal:** Bundesrat.
*   **Cantonal (Zurich):** Regierungsrat.
*   **Communal (City of Zurich):** Stadtrat.
*   **Communal (Small Villages):** Gemeinderat.

The terms "Grosser Rat," "Landrat," and "Generalrat" are used for *parliaments* in some other cantons, but never for the federal executive.
