# 🌍 Share of Foreigners: 25%

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In 2020, the proportion of foreign residents in Switzerland was approximately **25%**.

### A European Comparison
This is one of the highest percentages of foreign residents in the world.
*   **Cities:** In some cities like Geneva or Zurich, the percentage is even higher (around 30-40%).
*   **Composition:** Most foreigners are from neighboring European countries (Italy, Germany, France).
*   **Integration:** Foreign residents are a vital part of the Swiss economy and society. They pay taxes and contribute to the social security system.
*   **Citizenship:** Unlike some other countries, living in Switzerland for a long time does not automatically make you a citizen. You must actively apply for naturalization (Einbürgerung) to get the right to vote.

This high share of non-citizens is a central topic in Swiss political debates about democracy, immigration, and national identity.
