# 🇨🇭 The End of the Old Order: 1798

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **invasion of the French** led to the political reorganization of the Confederacy in 1798.

### The Collapse of the "Old Zurich"
Before 1798, the Swiss cantons were governed by small groups of noble families or powerful guilds (Patrizier/Zünfte). There was no equality; some regions (like Vaud or Aargau) were ruled as "subject territories" (Untertanengebiete) by other cantons.
*   **Napoleon's Influence:** Following the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Switzerland to secure the Alpine passes and the state treasury of Bern.
*   **The Helvetic Republic:** The old system collapsed. The French established the "Helvetic Republic," a centralized state where **all residents were equal** for the first time.
*   **Legacy:** Although the Helvetic Republic failed and was replaced in 1803, the "spirit of 1798" introduced the modern ideas of **individual liberty** and **equality** that would later become the foundation of the 1848 Constitution.
