# 🌍 Switzerland and the UN: 2002

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Switzerland has been a member of the **United Nations (UNO)** since 2002.

### A Historic Decision
For a long time, Switzerland stayed out of the UN because it feared membership might conflict with its **Neutrality**.
*   **1986:** Swiss voters rejected joining the UN by a massive margin (75% "No").
*   **2002:** After years of debate, a second initiative to join was **accepted** by 54.6% of the voters and a majority of cantons.
*   **Significance:** Switzerland was the first (and only) country to join the UN based on a popular vote of its citizens.
*   **Role:** Since 2002, Switzerland has been a very active member, focusing on peace promotion, humanitarian aid, and human rights. In 2023-2024, Switzerland served for the first time as a non-permanent member of the **UN Security Council**.

While being a "full member," Switzerland remains firmly committed to its neutral status, which is respected by the other UN member states.
