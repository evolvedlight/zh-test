# 🏛️ Zurich in the Council of States

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Canton of Zurich is represented by **2 people** in the **Council of States** (Ständerat) in Bern.

### Federal Equality
This is a core principle of Swiss federalism. To ensure that the small cantons are not dominated by the large ones:
*   **Most Cantons:** Have 2 seats in the Ständerat.
*   **Half-Cantons:** Have 1 seat (Appenzell, Basel, Unterwalden).
*   **Zurich's Power:** Even though Zurich has the largest population (represented by 36 seats in the Nationalrat), it has the same influence in the Ständerat as a small canton like Uri or Glarus.

### The Mandate
The two Zurich Ständeräte are elected directly by the people of Zurich for a 4-year term. Their task is to bring the "Cantonal Perspective" to the law-making process in Bern.
