# ⛪ Huldrych Zwingli: The Zurich Reformer

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531) was a famous **Reformer in Zurich**.

### The Break with Rome
Zwingli was the priest at the **Grossmünster** in Zurich. Starting around 1519, he began to preach ideas that challenged the Catholic Church:
*   **The Bible:** He argued that only what was written in the Bible should be followed (Sola Scriptura).
*   **Austerity:** He removed images, organs, and incense from the churches, making the religious service focus entirely on the sermon and the word of God.
*   **State and Church:** He worked closely with the Zurich city government to reform the social and moral life of the city.
*   **Death:** Zwingli died in the Battle of Kappel (1531) fighting against the Catholic cantons of Central Switzerland.

### Legacy
Zwingli's work transformed Zurich into a Protestant city and laid the foundation for the "Reformed" tradition that spread through much of Switzerland and abroad. His statue stands today outside the **Wasserkirche** near the Limmat.
