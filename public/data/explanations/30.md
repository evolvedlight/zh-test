# 🗳️ Passive Voting Right: Who Can Be Elected?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: **Anyone who is a Swiss citizen and has reached the age of 18** (Stimm- und Wahlrecht) can be elected to a political office on the federal level.

### Why is this Important?
This is the **Passive Election Right** (Passives Wahlrecht).
*   **No Property Requirement:** You don't need to be rich or own land (unlike in the 19th century).
*   **No Educational Requirement:** You don't need a university degree.
*   **No Political Party:** You can run as an independent, though it's hard to win without party support.

### Exclusions
Only those who are **incapable of judgement due to mental illness or weakness** are excluded (bevormundet).
