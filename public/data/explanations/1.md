# 🕊️ Swiss Neutrality

**From the official brochure:** "Die Schweiz mischt sich nicht in Kriege ein."

Switzerland has been an independent and neutral country since the **Congress of Vienna in 1815**.
Being neutral means Switzerland:
- Does not take part in armed conflicts between other countries.
- Must be able to defend itself (which is why it has an army).
- Is not involved in military alliances like NATO.

Because it is neutral, Switzerland hosts the headquarters of many international organizations, such as the UN (United Nations) and the Red Cross (ICRC), which was founded by the Swiss Henry Dunant.
