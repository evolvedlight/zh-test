# ⚖️ Amnesty International: Human Rights

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Amnesty International is an organization that campaigns for the **respect of human rights** worldwide.

### What they do
Founded in 1961, Amnesty is a global movement of millions of people. Their main tasks include:
*   **Monitoring:** Documenting violations of human rights (like torture, unfair trials, or restricted freedom of speech).
*   **Advocacy:** Pressuring governments to change their laws and release prisoners of conscience.
*   **Publicity:** Launching letter-writing campaigns and public protests to draw attention to injustice.

### Human Rights in Switzerland
While Switzerland is a very safe country with strong human rights protections, Amnesty also monitors Swiss topics, such as the treatment of asylum seekers, police practices, and corporate responsibility of Swiss companies abroad. It is a key player in the **"Civil Society"**—the group of organizations independent of the state that work for the common good.
