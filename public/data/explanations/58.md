# 🏘️ The Municipalities: The Smallest Units

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: There are approximately **2,100 to 2,200 political municipalities** (Stand 2021) in Switzerland.

### Dynamic Numbers
The number of municipalities is constantly **decreasing**.
*   **Mergers (Fusionen):** Many small villages merge to form larger, more efficient administrative units. For example, the Canton of Glarus famously reduced its 25 municipalities to just 3 in 2011.
*   **Size:** They range from the City of Zurich (over 400,000 residents) to Corippo in Ticino (which had only about 10 residents before merging).

### Autonomy
Despite their small size, Swiss municipalities have significant power (Gemeindeautonomie). They:
*   Set their own local tax rates.
*   Manage local schools and infrastructure.
*   Have the primary power to grant **citizenship** (naturalization) to foreign residents.
