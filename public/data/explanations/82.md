# ⚖️ The Prohibition of Discrimination

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: If someone is denied a job due to their skin color or gender, it violates the **right to equal treatment (prohibition of discrimination)**.

### The Constitution Protects
Article 8 of the Constitution states that "No one may be discriminated against, in particular on grounds of origin, race, gender, age, language, social position, way of life, religious, ideological, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability."
*   **Application:** This applies to state actions (like hiring for the government) and, through specific laws (like the Gender Equality Act), to private employers as well.

### Fighting Discrimination
A person who believes they have been discriminated against can take their case to a court or a specialized office (like the Federal Commission against Racism or the Office for Gender Equality) to seek justice.
