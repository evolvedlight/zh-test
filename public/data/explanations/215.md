### The Jura Question
Historically, the region of Jura was part of the large **Canton of Bern**.
*   **The Conflict:** The people in the Jura region (who are French-speaking and mostly Catholic) felt they were being ignored and dominated by the German-speaking and mostly Protestant majority in Bern.
*   **The Movement:** After decades of political tension and several votes, the people of the northern Jura voted to separate.
*   **The Result:** On the 1st of January 1979, the Republic and Canton of Jura became the newest member of the Swiss Confederation.
*   **A Peaceful Solution:** The "Jura Question" is often cited as a prime example of how a democracy can solve a separatist conflict peacefully through voting and negotiation rather than violence.
*   **Ongoing:** Some towns (like Moutier) are still voting even today on whether they want to move from Bern to Jura.
