# 🆘 Local Social Services: Sozialhilfe

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Municipalities are responsible for paying **Social Assistance (Sozialhilfe)** in emergency situations.

### Financing Welfare
While social *insurances* (like retirement pensions - b) are handled at the federal or cantonal level, social *assistance* (welfare) is a local task.
*   **Case-by-Case:** The local social office checks the individual situation of the resident.
*   **Funding:** The money comes from the local municipality's budget (your local taxes).
*   **Scope:** It covers basic needs like rent, food, and health insurance for those who have no other source of income.

### What they do NOT pay for:
*   **Retirement (b):** This is paid by the national AHV and private Pensionskassen.
*   **Private costs (c, d):** Things like driving tests or vacation travel are your private responsibility and are not funded by the community.
