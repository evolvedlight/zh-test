# 🚄 Railway Companies in Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: SBB, BLS, SOB, and SZU are abbreviations for **Swiss railway companies** (Eisenbahngesellschaften).

### A Diverse Network
While the **SBB** (Federal Railways) is the largest, Switzerland has many other "private" or cantonal railway companies that are integrated into the national network:
1.  **BLS (Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon):** The second-largest railway, mostly active in the Canton of Bern and Central Switzerland.
2.  **SOB (Südostbahn):** Operates trains in Eastern Switzerland and across the Pre-Alps (e.g., the Voralpen-Express).
3.  **SZU (Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn):** A local Zurich company that operates the popular S-Bahn lines into the Sihltal and to the top of the Uetliberg.

### Integration
Thanks to the "Direct Transport" (Direkter Verkehr) system, you can buy a single ticket (or use a GA Travelcard) that is valid on all of these different railways, as well as on buses, trams, and boats. This seamless integration is what makes Swiss public transport so world-class.
