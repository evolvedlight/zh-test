# 🏥 Mandatory Membership: Health Insurance

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In Switzerland, you must be a member of a **health insurance** (Krankenkasse) company.

### The Obligation
The "Health Insurance Act" (KVG) makes insurance mandatory for every person residing in Switzerland.
*   **Individual Duty:** It is your responsibility to sign up. If you don't, the municipality will eventually assign you to a company and send you the bills.
*   **Solidarity:** By making everyone participate, the costs of the sick are covered by the premiums of the healthy.

### Freedom of Association
In a free democracy like Switzerland, you have the right **not** to be part of most other groups:
*   **Parties (a):** Joining a political party is purely voluntary.
*   **Sports Clubs (b):** You can play football or hike without being in a club.
*   **Auto Clubs (d):** Being in the TCS or ACS is a private choice for road assistance.
*   **Religions:** You also have the right to leave a church or religious group at any time.
