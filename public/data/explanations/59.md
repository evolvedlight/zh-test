# 🪜 The Three Levels of Government: The Municipality

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The lowest level of the Swiss federal system is the **Municipality (Gemeinde)**.

### The Three-Tier System
1.  **The Confederation (Bund):** National level (Bern).
2.  **The Canton (Kanton):** State level (e.g., Zurich).
3.  **The Municipality (Gemeinde):** Local level (e.g., Winterthur, Uster, or a small village).

### Why it Matters
The municipality is where "real life" happens. It is the level closest to the citizen. If you want to build a house, put your child in kindergarten, or get naturalized, you go to your municipality.

### Power sharing
This system ensures that power is not centralized in one city (like Bern). Each level has its own responsibilities and its own source of tax income.
