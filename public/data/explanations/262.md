# 🗺️ Switzerland: A Landlocked Country

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: From a geographical perspective, Switzerland is a **Binnenland (landlocked country)**.

### No Ocean Borders
Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe and has **no direct access to the sea**.
*   **Surrounded by Land:** It is bordered by five countries: Germany, France, Italy, Austria, and Liechtenstein.
*   **Water Access:** Despite being landlocked, Switzerland is often called the "Water Tower of Europe" because many major rivers (like the Rhine and Rhone) begin in its Alps.
*   **Navigation:** The only direct water connection to the world's oceans is via the **Rhine**, with the Port of Basel serving as Switzerland's gateway to the North Sea.

### Why it Matters
Being landlocked shaped Switzerland's history as a "transit country" for goods and people moving across the Alps. It also made the maintenance of good relations with all neighbors essential for trade and supplies.
