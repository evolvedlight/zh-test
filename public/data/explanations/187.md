# 🏠 Privacy and Landlord Access

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: You must allow your **landlord (Vermieter/in)** into your apartment if there is a **justified reason**.

### Respecting the Home
In Switzerland, the apartment is your "private sphere," protected by the Constitution. The landlord cannot just walk in whenever they want.
*   **Justified Reasons:** To check for damage, to perform necessary repairs, or to show the apartment to potential new tenants if you have already resigned.
*   **Advance Notice:** The landlord must announce their visit in advance (usually 48 hours) and coordinate the time with you.
*   **Emergencies:** In an emergency (e.g., a water pipe burst or fire), the landlord or emergency services can enter without notice.

### Other people
You do not have to let in the postman (a), politicians (c), or your boss (d) unless you want to. Even the **Police** usually need a "Search Warrant" (Hausdurchsuchungsbefehl) from a prosecutor to enter your home without your consent.
