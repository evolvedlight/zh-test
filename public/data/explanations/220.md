# 🇨🇭 Switzerland in WWII: Armed Neutrality

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: During World War II, Switzerland was **neutral but maintained political and economic relations with the warring powers**.

### A Difficult Balance
Switzerland was completely surrounded by the Axis powers (Germany and Italy) and their occupied territories.
*   **Military:** Switzerland mobilized its army (the "Réduit" strategy) to signal that invading would be very costly.
*   **Economic:** Because it was isolated, Switzerland had to trade with Nazi Germany to survive (receiving coal and food in exchange for industrial goods and weapons). This was a controversial necessity.
*   **Refugees:** Switzerland accepted around 300,000 refugees (including many soldiers), but also famously closed its borders to many Jewish refugees in 1942, a decision that was later officially apologized for.
*   **Gold:** Switzerland acted as a financial hub, which included the trade of gold stolen by the Nazis.

### Historical Review
In the 1990s, the "Bergier Commission" published a massive report critically reviewing Switzerland's role during the war, leading to a deeper public understanding of the complexities of "neutrality" in a total war.
