# 🪖 Defense: A National Responsibility

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **Confederation (Bund)** is responsible for the **military**.

### The Swiss Army
Defense is considered a matter of national sovereignty.
*   **Unified Force:** There is only one Swiss Army, not 26 separate cantonal armies.
*   **Mandate:** The military's tasks include territory defense, supporting civil authorities in crises (e.g., pandemics, natural disasters), and international peace promotion.
*   **Funding:** The army is financed entirely through the federal budget (tax money collected by the Bund).

### Cantonal Involvement
While the Bund is in charge, the cantons assist with some administrative tasks, such as organizing recruitment (Rekrutierung) and managing the "Sektionswesen" (tracking service members residing in their territory).
*   **Police:** Unlike the military, the police (internal security) is primarily the responsibility of the **Cantons**.
