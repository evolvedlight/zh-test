# 🗳️ Who Elects the 246 Members?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The members of the Federal Assembly are elected by the **eligible citizens (voters)**.

### The Breakdown
The 246 members are split between:
*   **National Council (200 seats):** Elected using **proportional representation** in most cantons. The more votes a party gets, the more seats it receives.
*   **Council of States (46 seats):** Elected usually by **majority vote** (except in Jura and Neuchâtel). Each canton (except half-cantons) has 2 seats.

### Who can vote?
Only Swiss citizens aged 18 and older have the right to participate in these elections. Foreign residents, even if they have lived in Switzerland for decades, are currently excluded from electing the national parliament.

### The Mandate
By electing these representatives, the voters delegate the power to make laws and elect the government (Federal Council) to the Parliament.
