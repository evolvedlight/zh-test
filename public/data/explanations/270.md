# 🗺️ The Goal of Spatial Planning: Raumplanung

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: A key task of spatial planning (Raumplanung) is the **protection of undeveloped landscapes**.

### Balancing Development
Because Switzerland is small and densely populated, land is a very precious resource. Spatial planning aims to coordinate the different interests in using land:
1.  **Zoning:** Separating building zones from agricultural and protection zones to prevent "urban sprawl" (Zersiedelung).
2.  **Sustainability:** Ensuring that nature, forests, and farmland are preserved for future generations.
3.  **Efficiency:** Encouraging building inside cities (densification) rather than taking up more green fields.
4.  **Quality of Life:** Providing enough space for recreation, housing, and business.

In 2013, Swiss voters accepted a strict new Spatial Planning Act to make it much harder to create new building zones, emphasizing the national priority of protecting the landscape.
*   **Other options:** While important, maintaining sewers (b), building malls (c), or local finances (d) are operational or administrative tasks, not the core goal of "spatial planning" itself.
