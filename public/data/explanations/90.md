# ⚖️ Obligations Specific to Men

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The only legal duty that applies exclusively to men in Switzerland is **military or civil defense service**.

### The Legal Basis
Article 59 of the Federal Constitution states: *"Every Swiss man is liable for military service. The law shall provide for an alternative civilian service."*
*   **Voluntary for Women:** For women, military service is voluntary.
*   **Debate:** There is an ongoing political debate in Switzerland about whether this should be changed to a "Citizens' Service" for everyone, regardless of gender.

### Equality in Other Areas
In all other legal matters, the principle of equality applies:
*   **Taxes (d):** Women and men pay taxes according to their income, not their gender.
*   **Family (c):** Both parents are responsible for the upbringing and support of their children.
*   **Politics (b):** Both genders have the same right to vote and run for office (since 1971 at the federal level).
