# 💸 Factors Influencing Your Taxes

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Your individual tax burden depends on your **taxable income and wealth (assets)**.

### Ability-to-Pay Principle
Switzerland follows the principle that those who have more should contribute more to the community.
1.  **Income Tax (Einkommenssteuer):** You pay a percentage of what you earn each year (wages, interest, dividends). The rate is "progressive," meaning the percentage increases as your income goes up.
2.  **Wealth Tax (Vermögenssteuer):** You pay a small percentage (usually a few per mille) of your total assets (bank accounts, stocks, real estate, cars) each year.

### What does NOT matter:
*   **Nationalty (c):** While the *method* of collection might differ (e.g., "Quellensteuer" for those without a C-permit), the *amount* is based on income/wealth, not your passport.
*   **Politics (b, d):** Being in a party or a government office does not change your tax rate.
*   **Location:** However, your taxes *do* depend on which **Canton and Municipality** you live in, as each sets its own rates.
