# 🏘️ The 160+ Municipalities of Zurich

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: There are between **150 and 170 municipalities** in the Canton of Zurich (specifically 160 as of 2024).

### Variety
These range from the massive **City of Zurich** (over 400,000 residents) to tiny villages with only a few hundred people.
*   **The 12 Districts:** These 160+ municipalities are grouped into 12 administrative districts.
*   **Autonomy:** Regardless of their size, each municipality has its own tax rate, its own local rules, and its own political life.
*   **Mergers:** The number slowly decreases over time as smaller municipalities merge (Fusion) to share costs and administration. For example, several municipalities recently merged to form the new municipality of "Illnau-Effretikon" or similar entities.
