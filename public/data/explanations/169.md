# 📄 Ending a Job: The Resignation

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: To end an employment relationship regularly, you must **resign in writing (ideally by registered mail) or have the receipt of the resignation confirmed in writing**.

### The Proper Procedure
While an oral resignation is technically legal (unless the contract says otherwise), it is **strongly discouraged** because it is impossible to prove later.
*   **Notice Periods:** You must respect the "Kündigungsfrist" stated in your contract (usually 1 month in the first year, 2-3 months after that).
*   **Timing:** The letter must reach the employer at the latest on the last working day of the month for the notice period to start the next month.
*   **Registered Mail (Einschreiben):** This provides you with a receipt from the post office, proving exactly when the letter was delivered.

### Why does it matter?
A correct resignation ensures that your salary is paid until the end of the contract and that your rights (like vacation days or insurance coverage) are protected during the transition.
