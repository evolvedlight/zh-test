# 🏭 The Industrial Revolution: Steam Power

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Steam Engine** (Dampfmaschine) fundamentally changed Swiss industry in the 18th and 19th centuries.

### Powering Progress
Before the steam engine, Swiss industry relied on water power (rivers) and human labor.
*   **Independence:** The steam engine allowed factories to move away from rivers and into cities like Zurich or Winterthur.
*   **Scale:** It enabled mass production in the textile and machine industries.
*   **Transport:** Most importantly, steam power led to the development of the **Railway** (Eisenbahn) and steamships on the lakes. This allowed Switzerland to transport its high-quality goods across the Alps and to the rest of the world.

While other inventions like the motor (a) and computer (d) came much later, the steam engine was the "engine" of the first industrial revolution that transformed Switzerland into an economic powerhouse.
