# 🗳️ The Ständemehr (Majority of Cantons)

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The "Ständemehr" (majority of the cantons) is one of two requirements often needed in Swiss national votes.

### The Double Majority
For constitutional changes or joining international organizations (like the UN), **both** majorities are required:
1.  **Volksmehr (Popular Majority):** More than 50% of all Swiss voters nationwide.
2.  **Ständemehr (Majority of Cantons):** A majority of the 26 cantons (at least 12 full votes).

### Why it Matters
This system protects the smaller, rural cantons from being overruled by the populous urban cantons (like Zurich, Bern, or Vaud).
*   **Full Cantons:** Have 1 vote each (e.g., Zurich, Uri, Geneva).
*   **Half Cantons:** Have 0.5 votes each (Obwalden/Nidwalden, Basel-Stadt/Basel-Landschaft, Appenzell Ausserrhoden/Innerrhoden).

### Historical Context
This federalist principle ensures that *territory* counts as much as *population*, reflecting the compromise made in 1848 to unite the diverse regions of Switzerland.
