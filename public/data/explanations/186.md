# 💍 The Marriage Procedure: Zivilstandsamt

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **engaged couple together** must announce their intention to marry at the Civil Registry Office (Zivilstandsamt).

### The Steps to Marriage
1.  **Preparation (Vorbereitungsverfahren):** You go to the Zivilstandsamt in the municipality where one of you lives. You must bring documents (birth certificates, proof of single status).
2.  **Verification:** The office checks if there are any "impediments" (like already being married or being too closely related).
3.  **The Ceremony:** Once approved, you can have the civil ceremony. It must take place in an official room of the Zivilstandsamt and requires **two adult witnesses**.
4.  **Religious Wedding:** A religious ceremony (in a church, mosque, etc.) is only allowed **after** the civil wedding has been completed and proven with a certificate.

This ensures that the state has a clear record of all marriages and that they follow the legal requirements of the Swiss Civil Code.
