# 👶 State Support for Families: Child Allowances

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Families in Switzerland receive support in the form of **Child Allowances** (Kinderzulagen).

### Why?
The goal is to help families with the high costs of raising and educating children.
*   **Amount:** The amount varies by canton, but there is a federal minimum. In Zurich, the allowance for a child up to age 16 is around **200-250 CHF** per month. For those in education (up to age 25), it is even higher.
*   **Right:** This is a legal right for all working parents (including self-employed) and those with low incomes.
*   **Financing:** Usually funded by the employers through contributions to the family compensation fund.

### Other supports
While there are scholarships (c) for higher education, these are only for families with low income, not for *all* families. Child allowances, however, are a universal benefit as long as you have a child and are in the workforce.
