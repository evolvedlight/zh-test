# 🏥 Social Security: Health and Accident

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The Swiss social security system includes **protection against the consequences of illness and accidents**.

### The Pillars of Social Security
Switzerland has a comprehensive social safety net designed to prevent poverty in difficult life situations.
1.  **Illness:** The mandatory health insurance (KVG) ensures that everyone has access to medical treatment.
2.  **Accident:** The mandatory accident insurance (UVG) covers the costs of medical treatment and lost wages if you have an accident.
    *   **Employees:** Are insured through their employer. If you work more than 8 hours a week for one employer, you are also covered for *non-work* accidents (NBU).
    *   **Others:** People not in employment (children, students, retirees) must include accident coverage in their private health insurance.

### Other Systems
The system also includes unemployment insurance (ALV) and old-age pensions (AHV). It does not usually cover things like theft (b), floods (c), or communication issues (d); those are covered by **private** insurance.
