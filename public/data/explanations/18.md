# 🏥 Duty of Every Resident: Health Insurance

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: All residents of Switzerland, regardless of nationality or income, are **legally required to have basic health insurance (KVG)**.

### How it Works
*   **Mandatory Basic Insurance:** Covers essential medical treatment, medications, hospital stays, and maternity care.
*   **Compulsory:** You must sign up within **3 months** of arriving in Switzerland or birth.
*   **Choice:** You can choose your provider (Krankenkasse) freely, but they *must* accept you for basic insurance regardless of age or health status.

### Why is it Important?
This system ensures solidarity: Everyone pays premiums (based on canton/age/deductible) so that everyone gets the same high standard of care when sick. The state subsidizes premiums for those with low incomes (Prämienverbilligung).
