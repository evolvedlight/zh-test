# 🎡 What is a Chilbi?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: On a "Chilbi" (traditional funfair), you can experience **a ride on a roller coaster** (Achterbahn).

### Local Funfairs
"Chilbi" is the Swiss-German word for **Kirchweih** (Church anniversary festival).
*   **Origin:** Historically, it was the celebration of the anniversary of the local church's dedication.
*   **Tradition:** Today, it is a secular folk festival held in many Zurich municipalities (e.g., the Wädenswiler Chilbi).
*   **Attractions:** You find fairground rides (roller coasters, carousels, bumper cars), market stalls selling traditional sweets like "Magenbrot" and "Zigerkrapfen," and shooting galleries.
*   **Social Event:** It is often the biggest social event of the year for a village or neighborhood, where people of all ages meet.

While some large Chilbis might have music tents, they are primarily fairs for entertainment and traditional food, not for high-culture events like operas (b) or official sports matches (c, d).
