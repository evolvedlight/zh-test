# 💸 Supplementary Benefits: Ergänzungsleistungen

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Supplementary benefits (EL) can be obtained when the **AHV or IV pension is not enough to cover the minimum cost of living**.

### The Safety Net
In Switzerland, the state ensures that no retiree or person with a disability has to live in poverty.
*   **Who gets it?** People who already receive an AHV (old-age) or IV (disability) pension but whose income and assets are below the "minimum subsistence level."
*   **Legal Right:** EL is **not welfare** (Sozialhilfe); it is a legal entitlement. If you meet the criteria, the state *must* pay.
*   **Costs Covered:** It helps pay for basic living costs, health insurance premiums, and particularly for the high costs of living in a nursing home (Pflegeheim).

### Why?
This ensures that the "1st Pillar" of the social security system actually fulfills its constitutional goal of covering basic needs for everyone.
*   **Other options:** Apprentices (a) or the unemployed (d) have other support systems (wages or ALV).
