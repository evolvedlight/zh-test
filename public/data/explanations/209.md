# 🇫🇷 The Helvetic Republic: Napoleon Bonaparte

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: In 1798, the European ruler **Napoleon Bonaparte** invaded Switzerland and transformed it for a short time into a centralized state.

### The Helvetic Republic (1798–1803)
Before Napoleon's invasion, Switzerland was a loose confederacy of sovereign cantons (Staatenbund).
*   **Centralization:** Napoleon created the "Helvetic Republic," a centralized state modeled after the French Republic.
*   **Abolition of Cantons:** The cantons lost their sovereignty and became mere administrative districts.
*   **New Rights:** This period introduced modern ideas like **equality before the law**, a unified currency, and the first "Swiss" citizenship.
*   **Failure:** The centralized model did not work in the diverse and traditional Swiss regions. In 1803, Napoleon himself had to return the sovereignty to the cantons in the "Mediation Act," but many modern institutions (like the national flag) have their roots in this period.
