# 🇨🇭 Defining the State: 1848

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: In the Federal Constitution of 1848, the Confederacy was redefined as a **federalist Bundesstaat (Federal State)**.

### Staatenbund vs. Bundesstaat
*   **Before 1848 (Staatenbund):** Switzerland was a "Confederacy of States"—a loose collection of sovereign cantons with no central government, currency, or army.
*   **After 1848 (Bundesstaat):** Switzerland became a "Federal State"—a single country where the central government (Bund) handles national tasks (defense, currency, foreign policy), but the cantons remain responsible for regional issues (education, police).

### Why it Matters
This change allowed Switzerland to develop into a modern industrial nation. It created a unified economic area (one currency, no internal customs) and established the political institutions we still use today, such as the Federal Council and the two-chamber Parliament. This "federalist" compromise allowed different language and religious regions to live together in one stable state.
