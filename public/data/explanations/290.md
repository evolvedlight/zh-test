# 🗺️ Zurich: Part of the Mittelland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Geographically, the Canton of Zurich belongs to the **Mittelland** (Swiss Plateau).

### The Plateau Landscape
The Mittelland is one of the three main geographical regions of Switzerland (alongside the Alps and the Jura).
*   **Topography:** It is characterized by hills, valleys, and lakes, with an average elevation between 400 and 700 meters.
*   **Climate:** The climate is relatively mild compared to the Alps, which made it the ideal place for the first settlements.
*   **Resources:** It has fertile soil for agriculture and a dense network of rivers.

### Why not the others?
*   **Jura (a):** These are the limestone mountains in the northwest.
*   **Seenplatte (b):** While Zurich has lakes, "Seenplatte" is more a term for the lake region in Aargau or parts of Germany.
*   **Tössebene (d):** This is a specific small sub-region within the Canton of Zurich (near Winterthur), not the entire geographical classification of the canton.
