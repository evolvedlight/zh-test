# ⚖️ Arbitrary Power vs. Rule of Law

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In a "Rechtsstaat" (State based on the rule of law), it is strictly forbidden to **arrest and imprison people without a legal reason**.

### Habeas Corpus
This principle protects individuals from the arbitrary power of the state.
*   **Legal Basis:** No one can be deprived of their liberty except in the cases specified by law and in the manner prescribed by law.
*   **Judicial Review:** Anyone arrested must be brought before a judge quickly (usually within 24-48 hours) to check if the arrest is legal.
*   **Right to Information:** You must be told immediately why you are being detained.

### What is NOT forbidden:
*   **Criticism (a, b):** In a democracy, questioning the work of the government or criticizing laws is not only allowed but essential for progress.
*   **Religion (d):** Freedom of association and religion allows anyone to join a religious group, provided it does not break the law.
