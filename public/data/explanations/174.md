# 🇨🇭 National Holiday: August 1st

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **1st of August** is the only public holiday that is legally recognized across the entire country.

### The Federal Holiday
*   **Significance:** It commemorates the traditional founding of the Swiss Confederacy in **1291** (the Rütli Oath).
*   **Law:** While most other holidays (like Christmas or Easter) are regulated by the **Cantons**, the 1st of August was made a national holiday by a popular vote in 1993.
*   **Celebration:** People celebrate with bonfires, fireworks, speeches by politicians, and "Lampions" (paper lanterns) for children.

### Cantonal Differences
Holidays like Ascension (b), Good Friday (c), or May 1st (d) are holidays in *many* cantons, but not all. For example, some Catholic cantons have different holidays than Protestant ones. Only the 1st of August is a day off for everyone in Switzerland by federal law.
