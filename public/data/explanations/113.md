# 🗳️ Electing the Zurich Government

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The members of the Zurich government (Regierungsrat) are **elected directly by the people (voters)**.

### The Election System
Unlike the federal government (Bundesrat), which is elected by the Parliament, most cantonal governments in Switzerland (including Zurich) are elected by the people.
*   **System:** The election uses the **Majority Vote** (Majorzwahl).
*   **Requirements:** A candidate must receive an "absolute majority" of the votes to be elected in the first round. If seats remain open, a second round (relative majority) is held.
*   **Direct Link:** This gives the government members a direct democratic mandate from the citizens of the canton.
*   **Frequency:** Elections happen every 4 years, usually on a Sunday in early spring.
