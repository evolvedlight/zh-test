# 🗞️ The "Fourth Estate": The Media

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **media** (newspapers, radio, television, online news) are often referred to as the "Fourth Power" (vierte Gewalt) in the state.

### Why the "Fourth Power"?
While the state has three formal powers (Legislative, Executive, Judiciary), the media plays a crucial role in a democracy:
1.  **Watchdog:** They monitor the government and report on scandals, corruption, or mistakes.
2.  **Information:** They provide the facts citizens need to form an opinion for elections and votes.
3.  **Forum:** They provide a space for public debate between different political views.

### Press Freedom
For the "Fourth Power" to work, it must be independent. The state is not allowed to censor the media or dictate what they should report. In Switzerland, this freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution.
