# 🗓️ The Sacred Voting Sunday

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: National elections and votes always take place on a **Sunday**.

### The Timing
*   **Official Day:** Sunday is the official voting day. Polling stations are typically open for a few hours on Sunday morning (e.g., from 10:00 to 12:00).
*   **Saturday Alternative:** Many municipalities also open polling stations on Saturday for a few hours.
*   **Postal Voting:** Since most people vote by mail, they can actually "vote" on any day in the weeks leading up to the deadline, but the count officially happens on that Sunday.

### Why Sunday?
Historically, Sunday was the only day off for the working population. While the society has changed, the tradition remains as a symbol of the "Feast of Democracy." By noon on Sunday, the first results and projections (Hochrechnungen) start appearing on national TV.
