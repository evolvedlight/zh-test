# 👴 What is the AHV?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: AHV stands for **Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherung** (Old-Age and Survivors' Insurance).

### The Meaning
It is the most important social insurance in Switzerland.
*   **Alters (Old-Age):** It pays a monthly pension to people who have reached the retirement age (currently 65 for both men and women, with some transitional rules).
*   **Hinterlassenen (Survivors):** It provides financial support to widows, widowers, and orphans if the insured person dies. This ensures that a family does not fall into poverty if the main breadwinner passes away.

### Universal Coverage
The AHV is mandatory for everyone who lives or works in Switzerland. Even people who do not work (like students or homemakers) must pay a minimum contribution each year. This makes the AHV a powerful tool for social cohesion and stability.
