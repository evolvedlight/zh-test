# 💡 The Power of the Popular Initiative

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The popular initiative is important because it allows citizens to **politically enforce important concerns from the population**.

### Driving Change
Unlike the referendum, which is a "veto" or "brake," the initiative is the **"accelerator."** It allows citizens to put a topic on the national agenda that the Parliament might have ignored or rejected.
*   **Signatures:** 100,000 required within 18 months.
*   **Constitutional Change:** Initiatives always aim to change or add to the **Federal Constitution**.

### Impact
Even if an initiative is rejected at the ballot box, it often forces the Parliament to create a "Counter-proposal" (Gegenvorschlag) that addresses the issue in a more moderate way. Famous examples include the initiative for the "AHV" (pension system) or the protection of the Alps.
