# ⚖️ Extradition of Swiss Citizens

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Swiss citizens may **generally not be extradited** to other countries, except for proceedings before **international courts** (like the International Criminal Court).

### Protection of Citizens
Article 25 of the Federal Constitution guarantees this: *"Swiss citizens may not be expelled from Switzerland and may only be extradited to a foreign authority with their consent."*
*   **The Rule:** If a Swiss citizen commits a crime in Germany and then returns to Switzerland, Switzerland will usually refuse to hand them over to Germany for trial.
*   **Consequence:** This does not mean they stay unpunished! Switzerland has the duty to put the person on trial in a **Swiss court** for the crime they committed abroad (Prosequere aut dedere).
*   **Exceptions:** A citizen can be extradited if they **consent** to it in writing. Extradition to international criminal tribunals (e.g., for war crimes) is also allowed.
