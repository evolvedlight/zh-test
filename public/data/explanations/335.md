# 🛡️ Switzerland and the OSCE: Peacekeeping

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In the OSCE, Switzerland is particularly committed to **peacekeeping in Eastern Europe and Central Asia**.

### What is the OSCE?
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE / OSZE) is the world's largest regional security organization.
*   **Focus:** It deals with "Comprehensive Security," including arms control, human rights, and freedom of the press.
*   **Swiss Role:** As a neutral country, Switzerland is an ideal mediator. It often provides experts for election monitoring and specialized diplomacy to resolve conflicts (e.g., in Ukraine, the Balkans, or the Caucasus).
*   **Chairmanship:** Switzerland held the chairmanship of the OSCE in 1996 and 2014, playing a key role in European security during those difficult times.

This commitment is part of Switzerland's "Active Neutrality"—using its neutral status to build bridges and prevent or de-escalate conflicts between other nations.
