# 🏥 Accidents at Work: The UVG

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: In the event of a serious accident at work, the costs are covered by the **Berufsunfallversicherung** (Occupational Accident Insurance).

### Mandatory Coverage
All employees in Switzerland are legally insured against accidents by their employer (under the UVG - Accident Insurance Act).
*   **Costs Covered:** It pays for all medical treatment (doctor, hospital, medication) and provides daily allowances (80% of salary) if the person cannot work.
*   **Non-Occupational (NBU):** If you work at least 8 hours a week, you are also insured through your employer for accidents that happen during your **free time** (e.g., skiing, hiking).

### Why?
This insurance protects both the employee (from high medical bills) and the employer (from having to pay the salary of a sick worker for a long time). It is a central pillar of the Swiss social safety net.
