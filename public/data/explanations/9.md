# 🌍 Political Rights of Swiss Abroad

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Swiss citizens living abroad (often called the "Fifth Switzerland") retain their **political rights** at the federal level. They can vote and elect representatives without traveling to Switzerland.

### How it Works
*   **Registration:** They must register with the Swiss representation (embassy/consulate) in their country of residence.
*   **Vote by Mail/E-Voting:** In most cases, they receive voting materials by post. Some cantons offer electronic voting trials.
*   **Restrictions:** While they can vote on federal matters (initiatives, referendums, National Council elections), their rights at the cantonal or communal level depend entirely on the specific canton where they are registered.

### The Significance
With over 800,000 Swiss living abroad (approx. 11% of the population), their vote can be decisive in tight races. They represent a unique perspective on Swiss politics from an international viewpoint.
