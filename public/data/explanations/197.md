# 💸 Local Taxes: Income Tax

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **Income Tax** (Einkommenssteuer) is the most significant tax collected by the Cantons and Municipalities.

### Financing the State
Every person working in Switzerland pays income tax to three levels:
1.  **Bund (Federal):** A small progressive tax.
2.  **Kanton (Zurich):** A significant tax that funds cantonal tasks (University, Police, Roads).
3.  **Gemeinde (Municipality):** Usually calculated as a percentage of the cantonal tax. This funds local schools and services.

### Progression
Switzerland uses a "Progressive" tax system: The higher your income, the higher the *percentage* you pay. This is intended to be socially fair.
*   **Other options (a, b, c):** The "Verrechnungssteuer" (Withholding Tax), Alcohol Tax, and Customs (Zölle) are all **federal taxes** managed by the Bund in Bern, not by the local cantons.
