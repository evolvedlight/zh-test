# 🏛️ The Federal Chancellor: Chief of Staff

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler/in) **supports the Federal Council**. They are often referred to as the "eighth Federal Councillor," though they do not have a vote in government decisions.

### Key Responsibilities
The Chancellor heads the **Federal Chancellery**, which acts as the staff office for the government. Their duties include:
*   Planning and organizing Federal Council meetings.
*   Informing the public about government decisions (acting as spokesperson).
*   Checking the validity of initiatives and referendums (counting signatures).
*   Organizing national elections and votes.

### Election
Like the Federal Councillors, the Chancellor is elected by the **United Federal Assembly** (National Council + Council of States) for a term of four years.

### Historical Context
The position is actually older than the Federal Council itself, dating back to the Napoleonic era (1803), whereas the Federal Council was established in 1848.
