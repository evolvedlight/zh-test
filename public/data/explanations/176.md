# 👔 Exemption from ALV Premiums

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: **Retired persons** do not pay premiums for the Unemployment Insurance (ALV).

### Who Pays?
The ALV is a "solidarity" insurance for those in the workforce.
*   **Active Workers:** Every employee (c) and apprentice (a) pays a percentage of their salary into the ALV.
*   **Retirees:** Once you reach the official retirement age (65), you are no longer considered part of the "labor market" that the ALV protects. Therefore, you stop paying these contributions.
*   **Over 50s:** There is no exemption for older workers (d). As long as you are employed and below the retirement age, you must pay.

### Why?
The purpose of the ALV is to support you if you lose your job. Since a retiree is no longer looking for work and receives a pension instead of a salary, they cannot be "unemployed" in the legal sense and thus don't need the insurance.
