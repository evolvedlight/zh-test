# 🗳️ The Power of the Referendum

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Citizens can stop a new law using a **referendum**. This is a powerful instrument of direct democracy that acts as a "brake" on the parliament.

### How it Works
If the Parliament passes a new law or changes an existing one, citizens who disagree have **100 days** to collect **50,000 signatures**.
*   If they succeed, a national vote (referendum) is held.
*   For the law to be rejected, a simple majority of the people (Volksmehr) is sufficient; the "Ständemehr" (majority of cantons) is not needed for optional referendums.

### Optional vs. Mandatory
*   **Optional Referendum:** For normal laws. Requires signatures.
*   **Mandatory Referendum:** Required automatically if the Parliament wants to change the **Constitution** or join a supranational community.

### Modern Relevance
Recent examples include referendums on the CO2 Act or the Covid-19 Act. It forces politicians to compromise *before* passing laws, knowing the people can have the final say.
