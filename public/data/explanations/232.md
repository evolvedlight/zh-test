# ⛪ Confessional Division in Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Reformation** led to the confessional (religious) split of Switzerland.

### A Divided Country
During the 16th century, Switzerland became a patchwork of religions:
*   **Protestant (Reformed):** Zurich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and Geneva. These were often the wealthy, urban cantons.
*   **Catholic:** Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Fribourg, and Solothurn. These were mostly rural, mountainous regions.
*   **Conflict:** This division led to internal wars (the Wars of Kappel) and centuries of political mistrust. For a long time, the cantons were more loyal to their religious allies than to the Confederacy as a whole.

### Resolution
This split was only finally overcome with the founding of the Federal State in **1848**, which established religious freedom and the neutrality of the state towards all confessions. Today, the "religious border" is no longer a political border, but it still shapes the traditions and landscapes of the various cantons.
