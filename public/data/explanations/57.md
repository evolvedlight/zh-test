# 🇨🇭 The 26 Cantons of Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Switzerland consists of **26 cantons** (20 full cantons and 6 half-cantons).

### Full vs. Half Cantons
*   **20 Full Cantons:** Each has 2 seats in the Council of States and 1 full vote in the "Ständemehr" (Majority of Cantons). Examples: Zurich, Bern, Geneva.
*   **6 Half-Cantons:** These are pairs that split historically. Each has only 1 seat in the Council of States and 0.5 votes in the Ständemehr.
    1.  **Obwalden / Nidwalden** (Unterwalden)
    2.  **Basel-Stadt / Basel-Landschaft**
    3.  **Appenzell Ausserrhoden / Appenzell Innerrhoden**

### History
*   **The Original Three (1291):** Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden.
*   **Expansion:** Over centuries, more cantons joined or were created (e.g., Zurich in 1351, Ticino in 1803).
*   **The Newest Canton:** **Jura**, which separated from Bern in 1979 after a popular vote.
