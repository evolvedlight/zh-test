# 🎶 How to Yodel: The Voice

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: To yodel, you only need your **voice** (Stimme).

### The Technique
Yodeling is a specialized vocal technique. It requires the singer to quickly switch between two different vocal registers:
1.  **Chest Register (Bruststimme):** For the low, powerful notes.
2.  **Head Register (Kopfstimme/Fistelstimme):** For the high, light notes.

### No Instruments Needed
The beauty of yodeling is that it is a "pure" form of expression. While it is often accompanied by instruments like the **Schwyzerörgeli** (a small Swiss accordion) or the **Alphorn**, the act of yodeling itself is entirely performed by the human vocal cords. It requires great control and training to make the "yodel break" (the transition between registers) sound smooth and melodic.
