# 🇨🇭 The Civil War of 1847

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: In the Sonderbund War of 1847, **Catholics and Liberals** fought against each other.

### The Conflict
This was the last armed conflict on Swiss soil.
*   **The Sonderbund:** Seven Catholic-conservative cantons (including Lucerne, Uri, and Schwyz) formed a "Separate League" (Sonderbund) to protect their traditional rights and the role of the Catholic Church.
*   **The Liberals:** The majority of the cantons (led by Zurich and Bern) wanted a modern, unified federal state with more central power.
*   **The War:** It lasted only 25 days and resulted in relatively few casualties (under 100 dead). The Federal army, led by General Guillaume-Henri Dufour, won decisively.

### The Result
The victory of the Liberals paved the way for the creation of the **Federal Constitution of 1848**. Crucially, the winners were wise enough not to punish the losers too harshly, allowing the Catholic cantons to integrate into the new Switzerland, ensuring long-term peace and stability.
