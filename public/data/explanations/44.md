# 🏛️ The Council of States: Voice of the Cantons

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Council of States (Ständerat) **represents the interests of the cantons**.

### The Federal Compromise
The Ständerat is the second chamber of the Federal Assembly.
*   **Structure:** It has **46 members**.
*   **Representation:** Each "Full Canton" (like Zurich or Bern) has **2 seats**. Each "Half-Canton" (like Obwalden or Basel-Stadt) has **1 seat**.
*   **Purpose:** This system ensures that small cantons (like Uri or Glarus) have the same voting weight in this chamber as huge cantons like Zurich. This prevents the most populous regions from dictating terms to the rest of the country.

### Equality
Crucially, the Council of States has **exactly the same power** as the National Council. A law can only pass if both chambers agree.
