# ✍️ Signatures for a Popular Initiative

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A federal popular initiative requires **100,000 valid signatures**.

### The Rules
*   **Timeframe:** The signatures must be collected within **18 months** from the publication of the initiative text.
*   **Verification:** Each signature is checked by the local municipality to ensure the person is a Swiss citizen and eligible to vote.
*   **Target:** All initiatives aim to change the **Federal Constitution**. You cannot launch an initiative for a simple law (that's what the Parliament does).

### Why 100,000?
This number represents about 1.8% of the eligible voters. It is high enough to ensure the topic has significant public interest, but low enough to make direct democracy accessible to various social groups and parties.
*   **Referendum:** Requires only 50,000 signatures (but within only 100 days).
