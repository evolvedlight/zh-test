# 👔 The General Strike of 1918

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: A major consequence of the General Strike (Landesstreik) in 1918 was the introduction of the **48-hour workweek**.

### Context
In November 1918, shortly after the end of World War I, over 250,000 workers across Switzerland went on strike. They were protesting against poverty, high inflation, and the lack of political rights for the working class.
*   **Demands:** The "Olten Action Committee" demanded:
    *   Women's suffrage (right to vote).
    *   Proportional representation in parliament.
    *   The 48-hour week.
    *   Old-age and disability insurance (the start of the AHV).
*   **Outcome:** Although the army suppressed the strike, the government realized it had to act. Proportional representation was introduced shortly after, and the 48-hour week became the new legal standard for factory work, greatly improving the lives of workers.
*   **Stability:** This event led to the development of the "Social Partnership," where unions and employers negotiate instead of striking.
