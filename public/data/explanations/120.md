# 🏗️ The Authority for Building Permits

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: In the Canton of Zurich, the **municipality (Gemeinde)** is responsible for granting building permits.

### The Building Process
If you want to build a house or change an existing building, you must go through the "Baubewilligungsverfahren":
1.  **Application:** You submit plans to the local building authority (Bauamt).
2.  **Public Notice:** The project is published in the local newspaper and marked with "profiles" (Baugespanne) on the land so neighbors can see the height and shape.
3.  **Review:** The municipality checks if the project follows the local zoning laws (Nutzungsplanung) and building codes.
4.  **Approval:** If everything is correct, the municipality issues the permit.

### Neighbor's Rights
While neighbors (a) cannot "grant" the permit, they have the right to **object** (Rekurs) if they believe the project violates legal regulations.
