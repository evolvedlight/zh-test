# 🇮🇹 The Helvetians: Switzerland's Roman Era

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: During the time of ancient Rome, the **Helvetians** (Helvetier) lived in the territory of what is now Switzerland.

### Who were the Helvetians?
The Helvetians were a **Celtic** people. Around 58 BC, they tried to migrate to Western France but were stopped and defeated by **Julius Caesar** at the Battle of Bibracte. They were forced to return to the Swiss plateau and eventually became part of the Roman Empire.

### Roman Influence
The Romans ruled the area for about 400 years, leaving a deep cultural legacy:
*   **Language:** The Latin spoken by the Romans developed into French, Italian, and Romansh.
*   **Cities:** They founded many major Swiss towns, such as Aventicum (Avenches), Vindonissa (Windisch), and **Turicum** (Zurich).
*   **Infrastructure:** They built the first stone roads, aqueducts, and amphitheaters.

The name "Helvetia" is still used today as the formal Latin name for Switzerland (Confoederatio Helvetica), and you can see the abbreviation "CH" on cars and in internet addresses.
