# 🇪🇺 Relations with the EU: Bilateral Agreements

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Switzerland's relationship with the European Union (EU) is regulated through the **Bilateral Agreements**.

### The "Special Path" (Sonderweg)
Switzerland is one of the few countries in Europe that is neither in the EU (a) nor the EEA (EWR). Instead, it has negotiated a complex system of over 120 sector-specific treaties.
*   **Bilateral I (2000):** Covers economic topics like the **Free Movement of Persons** and technical barriers to trade.
*   **Bilateral II (2004):** Covers cooperation in areas like **Schengen/Dublin** (security and asylum) and environmental protection.
*   **Goal:** These agreements allow Switzerland to participate in the European single market while maintaining its political independence and neutrality.

### Current Status
The "Bilateral Path" requires constant negotiation and adaptation to new EU rules. It remains one of the most important and debated topics in Swiss foreign policy.
