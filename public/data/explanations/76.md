# ⚖️ The "Rechtsstaat": Rule of Law

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In a "Rechtsstaat" (State based on the rule of law), **the State itself must follow the laws**.

### What it Means
*   **Legal Basis:** The government and police can only act if there is a law that allows them to do so (Principle of Legality).
*   **Equality:** The laws apply to everyone—rich or poor, citizen or foreigner, powerful politician or ordinary resident.
*   **Judicial Review:** If the state treats you unfairly or violates your rights, you can go to an independent court to challenge the state's action.

### Why is this Important?
It protects citizens from "Willkür" (arbitrary power). In a dictatorship, the leader is above the law. In a "Rechtsstaat" like Switzerland, the law is above the leader. This creates security and trust in the system.
