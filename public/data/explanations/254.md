*   **A New Order:** The Catholic Mass was abolished and replaced by a simpler Protestant service.
*   **Social Reform:** The property of the monasteries was taken over by the city and used to fund schools and social welfare for the poor.

Zwingli's reformation made Zurich a lighthouse of the Protestant faith in Europe and deeply shaped the culture, education system, and work ethic of the region for centuries to come.
