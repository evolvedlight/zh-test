# 🗳️ Voting Eligibility in Switzerland

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: To vote or run for office at the federal level, you must be a **Swiss citizen**.

### The Requirements
1.  **Citizenship:** You must hold a Swiss passport (naturalized or by birth).
2.  **Age:** You must be **18 years or older**.
3.  **Legal Capacity:** You must not be under legal guardianship due to mental incapacity.

### Residence vs. Citizenship
Unlike in some other countries, simply living or paying taxes in Switzerland (the residency principle) does not automatically grant federal voting rights. Citizenship is the key factor.

### Cantonal Differences
While federal rights are uniform, some **cantons** (like Neuchâtel or Jura) allow long-term foreign residents to vote in *cantonal* or *communal* elections. However, in **Zurich**, voting rights are strictly tied to Swiss citizenship at all levels (federal, cantonal, and communal).
