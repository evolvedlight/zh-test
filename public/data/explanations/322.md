### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The female figure on the 2-franc coin is the allegorical figure **Helvetia**.

### Who is Helvetia?
Helvetia is the **female personification of Switzerland**.
*   **Appearance:** She is typically shown wearing a toga, carrying a spear and a shield with the Swiss cross, and her hair is braided. She often looks towards the mountains.
*   **Symbolism:** She represents the Swiss Confederation, independence, and protection.
*   **Other Coins:** Helvetia also appears on the 1-franc and 1/2-franc coins (standing) and on the 50-centime coin (seated).
*   **Postage Stamps:** Because Switzerland is multilingual, postage stamps do not say "Schweiz," "Suisse," or "Svizzera." They simply say **HELVETIA**, which is understood in all regions.

Using a mythical figure like Helvetia allows all Swiss people to identify with the state without favoring one specific language, region, or religion.
