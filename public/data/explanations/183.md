# 🏠 The Rental Agreement: Mietvertrag

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The rental agreement (Mietvertrag) regulates the **rights and obligations of the contracting partners** (landlord and tenant).

### Key Contents
A standard rental agreement includes:
1.  **Object:** Which apartment or room is being rented?
2.  **Rent:** How much is the monthly rent and what are the "Nebenkosten" (extra costs for heating, water, etc.)?
3.  **Deposit:** How much money (usually 1-3 months' rent) must the tenant put in a special bank account as security?
4.  **Notice Period:** How much time in advance must you give notice to move out (usually 3 months)?
5.  **Rules:** General house rules (Hausordnung) regarding noise, pets, or use of the laundry room.

### Limits
The contract cannot regulate everything. For example, the landlord cannot tell you what to cook (c) or how to decorate your home (d), as long as you don't damage the property.
