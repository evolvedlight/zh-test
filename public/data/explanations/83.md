# 🗳️ Rights Reserved for Citizens

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The right to **participate in political elections and votes on the federal level** is only granted upon **naturalization (Einbürgerung)**.

### Citizenship Rights
While residents with a C-permit (unlimited residence) have many rights, they lack the "Political Rights" at the national level. These include:
1.  **Voting:** Casting a ballot for the National Council or on referendums/initiatives.
2.  **Election:** Being elected to the Parliament or the Federal Council.
3.  **Signatures:** Signing a popular initiative or a referendum.

### What you ALREADY have before naturalization:
*   **Associations (a):** Anyone can join a sports club, a cultural group, or a political party.
*   **Property (c):** Foreigners can buy real estate (with some restrictions for those not living in Switzerland).
*   **Job Choice (d):** Those with a valid residence permit (B or C) can usually choose their employer freely.
