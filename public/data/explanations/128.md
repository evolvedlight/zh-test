# 💸 The Tax Return: Steuererklärung

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The tax return **discloses the financial situation of the taxpayer to the tax authority**.

### What you report:
Once a year, you must fill out the forms (mostly online nowadays) and declare:
1.  **Income:** Wages, side income, interest from bank accounts, dividends from stocks, and pension payments.
2.  **Assets:** Total value of bank accounts, real estate, cars, and other valuables.
3.  **Deductions:** You can subtract certain costs to lower your taxes (e.g., transport to work, insurance premiums, charitable donations, interest on debts).

### Why is it important?
The "Steuererklärung" ensures that everyone pays their "fair share" according to the principle of ability to pay. The information is treated with strict confidentiality.
