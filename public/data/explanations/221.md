# 🧶 Industrialization: The Textile Industry

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: In the early 19th century, the **Textile Industry** was the most important driver of industrialization in Switzerland.

### From Cottages to Factories
Switzerland was one of the first countries in continental Europe to industrialize.
*   **Location:** Eastern Switzerland (Zürich, St. Gallen, Glarus) was the heart of the movement.
*   **Shift:** Production moved from "homeworking" (spinning and weaving in people's kitchens) to large, water-powered factories along the rivers (like the Limmat or Töss).
*   **Innovation:** Because Switzerland lacked raw materials (like coal), it had to focus on high-quality products and efficient machinery.
*   **Diversification:** The success of textiles led to the birth of the **Machine Industry** (to build weaving machines) and the **Chemical Industry** (to create dyes for the fabric). These industries remain pillars of the Swiss economy today.
*   **Railway:** The need to transport fabrics and machines quickly drove the construction of the national railway network.
