# 🏥 Who must have Health Insurance?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: **All residents** (alle Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner) of Switzerland must have basic health insurance.

### The Mandate
It doesn't matter if you are:
*   A child or an adult.
*   Employed, self-employed, or unemployed.
*   A Swiss citizen or a foreign resident with a permit.

Everyone living in Switzerland must be insured within **3 months** of their arrival or birth. This "Individual Mandate" ensures that the costs of the healthcare system are shared by the whole population, which keeps the system high-quality and accessible to all. If you cannot afford the premiums, the canton provides a "Premium Reduction" (Prämienverbilligung) based on your income.
