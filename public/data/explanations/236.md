# 🏥 The Birth of the ICRC: 1863

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)** was founded in Geneva in 1863.

### Henry Dunant's Vision
The ICRC was born from the shock of one man, **Henry Dunant**, who witnessed the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino (Italy) in 1859. He saw thousands of soldiers left to die on the battlefield without any medical care.
*   **The Goal:** To create national relief societies of volunteers to care for the wounded during wartime, regardless of which side they fought for.
*   **Neutrality:** The organization chose a red cross on a white background (the reverse of the Swiss flag) as its protective symbol.
*   **Geneva Conventions:** In 1864, the ICRC helped initiate the first "Geneva Convention," an international treaty protecting wounded soldiers and medical staff.

Today, the ICRC remains headquartered in Geneva and is one of the most respected humanitarian organizations in the world, dedicated to protecting victims of armed conflict.
