# ⚖️ The Labor Court: Arbeitsgericht

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The Labor Court is responsible for disputes where **an employee is dismissed without valid reason** (unfair dismissal).

### Handling Workplace Disputes
The "Arbeitsgericht" is a specialized court that deals only with employment law. It handles cases such as:
*   Unpaid wages or overtime.
*   Disputes over the content of a job reference (Arbeitszeugnis).
*   Discrimination or harassment at work.
*   Dismissals that violate protection periods (like pregnancy or illness).

### Easy Access
In many cantons (including Zurich), the procedure at the Labor Court is **free or very cheap** for disputes below a certain value (usually 30,000 CHF). This ensures that even workers with low incomes can fight for their rights against powerful employers.
*   **Other options:** Inheritance tax (a), neighbor disputes (c), or family finances (d) are handled by other specialized courts (Civil or Administrative).
