# 🏛️ The Head of the Village: Gemeindepräsident

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The highest representative in smaller Zurich municipalities is called the **Gemeindepräsidentin or Gemeindepräsident**.

### Titles in Zurich
*   **Cities (City of Zurich, Winterthur):** The head is called the **Stadtpräsident/in** (Mayor).
*   **Smaller Towns/Villages:** The head is called the **Gemeindepräsident/in**.

### Other Titles (Not used in Zurich)
*   **Gemeindeammann (b):** This title is used in other cantons like Aargau or Solothurn for the head of the municipality. In Zurich, a "Gemeindeammann" is actually a specific judicial official (responsible for service of process and seizures), not the political head.
*   **Bürgermeister (a):** Common in Germany and Austria, but almost never used in Switzerland.
*   **Bezirksamtmann (c):** Is not a political head of a municipality.
