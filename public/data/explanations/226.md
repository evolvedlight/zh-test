# 🇨🇭 The Founding Three: 1291

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: In 1291, the three "original cantons" (**Urkantone**) of **Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden** formed an alliance.

### The Federal Charter (Bundesbrief)
*   **The Date:** Traditionally, the beginning of August 1291 is seen as the birth of the Swiss Confederacy.
*   **The Location:** Legend says the leaders of the three valleys met on the **Rütli** meadow overlooking Lake Lucerne to swear an oath of mutual assistance.
*   **The Purpose:** They wanted to protect their freedom and legal rights against the increasing influence of the **Habsburgs** (a powerful noble family from what is now the Canton of Aargau).
*   **Significance:** This alliance was the seed from which modern Switzerland grew over the next 700 years. The names of the cantons still resonate today: the name "Switzerland" (Schweiz) is derived from "Schwyz," and the Swiss flag's cross is based on the banner of Schwyz.
