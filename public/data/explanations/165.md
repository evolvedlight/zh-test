# 🤰 Protection against Dismissal: Pregnancy

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: An employee cannot be dismissed if she is **pregnant**.

### Protection Periods (Sperrfristen)
The Swiss Code of Obligations (OR Art. 336c) protects employees from dismissal during certain difficult times:
1.  **Pregnancy:** Throughout the entire pregnancy and for 16 weeks after the birth.
2.  **Illness/Accident:** For a certain period depending on how long you have worked for the company (e.g., 90 days in the second year of service).
3.  **Military Service:** During service and for certain periods before and after.

### Consequences
A dismissal given during these "blocking periods" is **legally null and void** (nichtig). The employee continues to be employed and must be paid. This ensures that vulnerable workers are not suddenly left without an income.
*   **Other options:** Punctuality (a) or seniority (d) do not give you absolute protection from a regular dismissal.
