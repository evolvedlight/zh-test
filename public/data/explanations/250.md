# 🏚️ Prehistoric Heritage: Pile Dwellings

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: From 5000 to 1000 BC, people lived in **pile dwellings** (Pfahlbauten) around Lake Zurich.

### Life on the Water
These were prehistoric settlements built on wooden stilts along the shores of lakes and rivers.
*   **Location:** In Zurich, many such settlements have been discovered, for example at **Opera House (Sechseläutenplatz)** and **Enge**.
*   **Protection:** Living on stilts protected people from flooding and wild animals.
*   **Preservation:** Because the wood and artifacts (tools, clothing, food remains) were submerged in water and mud without oxygen, they were perfectly preserved for thousands of years.
*   **UNESCO World Heritage:** Since 2011, several of these pile-dwelling sites around the Alps (including sites in Zurich) have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

These settlements show that the shores of Lake Zurich have been a popular place to live for over 7,000 years!
