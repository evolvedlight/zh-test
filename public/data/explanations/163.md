# 👶 The Role of Parents in Upbringing

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The upbringing of children (Erziehung) is primarily the responsibility of the **parents**.

### Rights and Duties
In Switzerland, parents have "Parental Care" (Elterliche Sorge). This means:
*   **Freedom:** Parents can decide on the religious, cultural, and moral values they want to teach their children.
*   **Responsibility:** Parents must provide for the child's physical and mental well-being, protect them from harm, and ensure they receive an education.
*   **Support:** The State (a) and Schools (d) only step in to support the parents or if the child's well-being is at risk (adult and child protection).

### Collaboration
While parents lead the upbringing, they are expected to work closely with the schools to ensure the child's success in the education system.
