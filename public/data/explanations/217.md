# 🗳️ Women's Suffrage: 1971

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: Swiss women received the right to vote and stand for election at the federal level in **1971**.

### A Late Achievement
Switzerland was one of the last countries in the world to grant women the right to vote.
*   **Why so late?** Because of direct democracy! In other countries, the parliament could simply pass a law. In Switzerland, the **men** had to vote in a referendum to share their power with women.
*   **1959:** A first attempt to introduce women's suffrage was rejected by 67% of Swiss men.
*   **1971:** A second vote finally passed with 66% "Yes."
*   **Cantonal Level:** While many cantons followed quickly, the Canton of **Appenzell Innerrhoden** was forced by the Federal Supreme Court to grant women the vote only in **1990**!

### Today
Since 1971, women have become a vital part of Swiss politics. Many women have served as Federal Councillors and Presidents of the Confederation. Today, equality is a central constitutional value.
