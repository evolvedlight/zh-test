# 📄 Duty of Every Resident: Paying Taxes

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: All residents of Switzerland, regardless of nationality, have the **duty to pay taxes**. This is the primary way the state funds public services.

### Types of Taxes
1.  **Direct Federal Tax (Direkte Bundessteuer):** Paid to the Confederation based on income.
2.  **Cantonal Tax (Staatssteuer):** Paid to the Canton (e.g., Zurich). Rates vary significantly.
3.  **Communal Tax (Gemeindesteuer):** Paid to the Municipality. Often a percentage of the cantonal tax.
4.  **Church Tax (Kirchensteuer):** Usually mandatory for members of recognized churches, varies by canton.
5.  **Firefighting Tax:** In some cantons (like Zurich), a specific tax replaces mandatory service.

### Why is it Important?
Without taxes, Switzerland could not maintain its high-quality infrastructure (roads, trains), education system, healthcare, or social security. It is considered a civic duty to contribute fairly based on one's economic capacity.
