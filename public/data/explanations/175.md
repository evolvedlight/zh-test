# 👴 The Retirement Age: 65

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The standard retirement age (Rentenalter) in Switzerland is **65 years for both men and women**.

### Recent Changes (AHV 21)
Before a popular vote in **2022**, women retired at 64 and men at 65.
*   **Harmonization:** The new law ("AHV 21") gradually increases the retirement age for women to 65 by 2028.
*   **Flexibility:** While 65 is the "standard" age, you can choose to retire earlier (from age 63) for a reduced pension, or later (up to age 70) for an increased pension.
*   **Pensions:** At this age, you become eligible for your AHV pension (1st pillar) and your Pensionskasse savings (2nd pillar).

### Why the increase?
Because people are living longer, the AHV system needs more funding. Raising the retirement age is one way to ensure that the system remains financially stable for future generations.
