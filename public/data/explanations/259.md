# 🌊 The Path of the Rhine

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The Rhine (Rhein) flows into the **North Sea** (Nordsee).

### Journey of a River
The Rhine is one of the most important rivers in Europe.
*   **Source:** It begins in the Swiss Alps (Canton of Graubünden) as two small rivers, the Vorderrhein and Hinterrhein.
*   **Border:** It flows through the **Lake Constance** (Bodensee) and then forms the border between Switzerland and Germany/Liechtenstein.
*   **Route:** After leaving Switzerland at Basel, it flows north through Germany and France.
*   **Mouth:** It eventually reaches the Netherlands, where it forms a massive delta and flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam.

### Economic Importance
For Switzerland, the Rhine is a vital transport route. The **Port of Basel** is the only place where Switzerland has a direct connection to the world's oceans via water, allowing large cargo ships to transport goods all the way from the North Sea into the heart of Europe.
