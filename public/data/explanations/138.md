# 👴 The AHV and IV Systems

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **Old-Age, Survivors' and Invalidity Insurance (AHV/IV)** is the most important part of the Swiss social security system.

### The Two Components
1.  **AHV (Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherung):** This is the "1st Pillar" of the retirement system. It provides a basic pension to all retired people and to the surviving partners or children (Hinterlassene) of deceased insured persons.
2.  **IV (Invalidenversicherung):** This supports people who can no longer work (or can only work partially) because of a permanent health impairment (disability). The goal is first "integration" (helping the person find a suitable job) and only then "pension."

### Solidarity
The system is based on **Solidarity**: The current working generation pays for the pensions of the current retired generation ("pay-as-you-go" system). It is mandatory for everyone who lives or works in Switzerland.
