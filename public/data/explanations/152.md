# 💸 Wage Deductions: ALV

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The contribution for the **Arbeitslosenversicherung (ALV)** is deducted directly from an employee's salary.

### Payroll Taxes
When you look at your pay slip (Lohnabrechnung) in Switzerland, you will see several mandatory deductions:
1.  **AHV/IV/EO:** For old-age, disability, and income compensation (maternity/military).
2.  **ALV:** For unemployment insurance.
3.  **Pensionskasse (BVG):** For the occupational pension (2nd pillar).
4.  **NBU:** For non-occupational accident insurance.

### Why direct deduction?
This ensures that the insurance funds are consistently filled. Both the employee and the employer pay a share (usually 50/50) of these contributions. It ensures that if you lose your job, you have an immediate right to financial support.
