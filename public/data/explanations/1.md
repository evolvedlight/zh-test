# 🇨🇭 Understanding Swiss Neutrality

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: Switzerland does not involve itself in the armed conflicts of other states. This is the essence of "armed neutrality." It is not just a foreign policy choice but a legal obligation under international law (specifically the Hague Conventions of 1907).

### Historical Origins
While the Swiss Confederacy avoided many foreign entanglements after the Battle of Marignano in 1515, its permanent neutrality was formally recognized by the Great Powers of Europe at the **Congress of Vienna in 1815**. The powers agreed that a neutral Switzerland located at the heart of Europe was in the interest of the entire continent's stability.

### Rights and Duties
Being neutral grants Switzerland the right to territorial inviolability (no foreign troops can cross it). However, it also imposes strict duties:
* Switzerland cannot supply mercenaries or weapons to warring nations.
* It cannot join military alliances like **NATO** (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).

### Modern Context
Neutrality does not mean "opinion-less." Switzerland actively promotes peace, human rights, and humanitarian aid. This "active neutrality" allows it to serve as a mediator (Protecting Power mandate) and host international organizations like the UN and Red Cross in Geneva. Even joining the UN in 2002 was carefully debated to ensure it didn't conflict with neutrality.
