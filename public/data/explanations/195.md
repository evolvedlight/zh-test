# 🤝 The Freedom of Association

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: **Any person in Switzerland** is allowed to found an association (Verein).

### The "Verein" Culture
Associations are the backbone of Swiss social life. There are over 80,000 associations in Switzerland (sports clubs, music groups, political associations, etc.).
*   **Ease of Founding:** It is very simple. You only need:
    1.  A written set of **Statutes** (rules).
    2.  At least **two people** (though more are usually needed to fill roles like president and treasurer).
    3.  A **non-commercial** purpose (they shouldn't be for-profit companies).
*   **No Registration:** Most associations don't even need to be registered with the state (Handelsregister) unless they conduct a large business.

### Constitutional Right
Article 23 of the Constitution guarantees the "Freedom of Association." It is a fundamental right that allows citizens to organize themselves to pursue their common interests without state interference.
