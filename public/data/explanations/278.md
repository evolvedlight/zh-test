### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: As of 2020, approximately **2.1 million** foreigners were living in Switzerland.

### A Diverse Society
Switzerland has one of the highest percentages of foreign residents in Europe (about 25-26% of the total population).
*   **Nationalities:** The largest groups come from Italy, Germany, Portugal, and France.
*   **Reasons:** Most come for work or family reunification.
*   **Impact:** This diversity is a major economic strength, as foreign workers fill essential roles in every sector, from construction and healthcare to high-tech research and finance.

### Note
The total population of Switzerland is around **8.9 million** (2024), so foreigners make up about one quarter of the "Sovereign of the residents," although not yet the "Sovereign of the voters."
