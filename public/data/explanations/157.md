# 🏥 Obligatory Insurances: Krankenversicherung

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Krankenversicherung** (Health Insurance) is mandatory in Switzerland.

### Compulsory vs. Voluntary
*   **Mandatory:** Every resident must have basic health insurance (Grundversicherung).
*   **Voluntary:** "Zusatzversicherungen" (Supplementary insurances) for private hospital rooms or dental work are optional.

### Other Insurances in the Options:
*   **Haftpflichtversicherung (a):** Private liability insurance is highly recommended but generally **not mandatory** (except for car owners or in some specific rental contracts).
*   **Arbeitsversicherung (c):** There is no such thing as "Arbeitsversicherung"; the mandatory one is "Arbeitslosenversicherung" (Unemployment).
*   **Vermögensversicherung (d):** Protecting your wealth is purely private and optional.
