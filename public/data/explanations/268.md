# 🏔️ Mountain Cantons: Valais

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: **Wallis** (Valais) is a classic mountain canton (Bergkanton).

### High Altitudes
While most Swiss cantons have some hills, "Mountain Cantons" are those where the Alps dominate the landscape and the economy.
*   **Valais:** Home to the highest peaks, such as the Matterhorn and the Dufourspitze. It is located entirely within the Alps.
*   **Other Bergkantone:** Graubünden, Uri, Ticino, Glarus, Obwalden, and Nidwalden.
*   **The Plateau:** Cantons like **Zurich (c)**, **Aargau (d)**, and **Schaffhausen (b)** are part of the "Mittelland." While they have beautiful hills, they are not considered "Mountain Cantons."

### Life in the Mountains
Being a Bergkanton brings specific challenges and opportunities:
1.  **Tourism:** Winter sports and summer hiking are the main income sources.
2.  **Hydropower:** The steep valleys are perfect for large dams and electricity production.
3.  **Infrastructure:** Maintaining roads and railways in avalanche and landslide zones is very expensive.
