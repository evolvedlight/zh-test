# ⚖️ The Principle of Legal Equality

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: **All humans are equal before the law** (Rechtsgleichheit).

### What it Means
*   **No Discrimination:** The state cannot discriminate against anyone based on their origin, race, gender, age, language, social status, way of life, religious, philosophical, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental, or psychological disability.
*   **Equal Rights:** Men and women have equal rights (Art. 8, Para. 3 of the Constitution).
*   **Binding:** This applies to all laws (federal, cantonal, communal) and administrative actions.

### Historical Context
This principle was a cornerstone of the 1848 Constitution, abolishing privileges of the nobility or specific families. The article on gender equality was only added in **1981**, and full implementation took decades (e.g., women's suffrage in Appenzell IR in 1990).
