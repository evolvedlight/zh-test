# 🗳️ The Two Chambers: Nationalrat & Ständerat

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Swiss Parliament (Federal Assembly) consists of **two chambers** that have equal power:
1.  **Nationalrat (National Council):** Represents the *population* (200 members).
2.  **Ständerat (Council of States):** Represents the *cantons* (46 members).

### Why Two Chambers?
This is a federal compromise:
*   **Nationalrat:** Seats are distributed by population. Zurich has 36 seats, Uri has 1.
*   **Ständerat:** Seats are distributed by canton. Zurich has 2, Uri has 2. This prevents the large cantons from ignoring the small ones.

### The Legislative Process
For a law to pass, **both** chambers must agree on the exact same text. If they disagree, they negotiate back and forth (Differenzbereinigung) until a compromise is found or the bill fails.
