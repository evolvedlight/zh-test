# 👔 The 2nd Pillar: The Pensionskasse

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Pensionskasse** (occupational pension scheme / BVG) is the **second pillar** of the Swiss retirement system.

### How it Works
*   **Mandatory:** Every employee earning more than a certain minimum amount (currently around 22,000 CHF per year) must be insured.
*   **Individual Savings:** Unlike the AHV (where you pay for others), in the Pensionskasse, you save for **yourself**. Your contributions (and those of your employer) go into a personal account managed by your company's pension fund.
*   **Payout:** When you retire, you can choose to receive a monthly pension for the rest of your life or take out your savings as a lump sum (Kapitalbezug).

### Goal
The combined income from the 1st pillar (AHV) and the 2nd pillar (Pensionskasse) should be enough to cover about **60%** of your final salary, allowing you to maintain a similar lifestyle in retirement.
