# 🎶 The National Anthem: Schweizerpsalm

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The Swiss national anthem is called the **Schweizerpsalm** (Swiss Psalm).

### History and Meaning
*   **Composition:** The melody was written in 1841 by Alberich Zwyssig (a monk from Uri), and the lyrics were written by Leonhard Widmer (from Zurich).
*   **Style:** As the name suggests, it is written in the style of a psalm or a hymn. The lyrics describe the beauty of the Swiss landscape (mountains, sunrises, and storms) and express gratitude to God.
*   **Official Status:** For a long time, the unofficial anthem was "Rufst du, mein Vaterland" (to the tune of "God Save the Queen"). The Schweizerpsalm was only made the **official** national anthem in **1981**.

### Multilingualism
Reflecting the country's diversity, the anthem has official lyrics in all four national languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh). In Zurich, the German version is typically sung.
*   **New Anthem?** There have been attempts to create a new anthem with more modern and secular lyrics, but the Schweizerpsalm remains the official version today.
