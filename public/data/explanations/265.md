# 🏔️ The Three Geographical Regions

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The three major geographical regions of Switzerland are the **Jura, the Mittelland, and the Alps**.

### Landscape Diversity
Switzerland is divided into three distinct zones based on their landscape and elevation:
1.  **The Alps (approx. 60% of the area):** The high mountains in the south and center. They are the defining feature of Switzerland but are less densely populated.
2.  **The Mittelland (approx. 30%):** The plateau between the Alps and the Jura. This is the **heartland** of Switzerland, where the largest cities (Zurich, Bern, Geneva) are located and where most of the population lives and works.
3.  **The Jura (approx. 10%):** A range of lower limestone mountains in the northwest along the French border. It is a region of forests, valleys, and watchmaking traditions.

Understanding these regions is key to understanding Swiss climate, agriculture, and where people live.
