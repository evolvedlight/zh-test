# 👴 Mandatory Social Insurance

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The **AHV (Old-Age and Survivors' Insurance)** is a mandatory insurance in Switzerland.

### Compulsory for All
In Switzerland, you don't have a choice: if you live or work here, you **must** be part of the AHV system.
*   **Financing:** It is deducted directly from your salary (if you are an employee). Your employer pays half, and you pay half.
*   **Self-employed:** Must register and pay their own contributions.
*   **Non-working residents:** Must pay a minimum amount based on their wealth and pension income.

### Why is it mandatory?
The idea is "Solidarity." Everyone contributes so that everyone is guaranteed a basic income in old age. If it were voluntary, many people might forget to save, and the state would have to support them later through welfare, which would be even more expensive for the taxpayers.
