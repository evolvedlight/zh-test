# 🇨🇭 The Cantons: The Pillars of the State

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The Swiss federal state consists of various **Cantons (Kantone)**.

### What is a Canton?
A canton is a semi-autonomous state within the Swiss Confederation. Each canton has:
*   Its own **Constitution**.
*   Its own **Parliament** (e.g., Kantonsrat in Zurich).
*   Its own **Government** (e.g., Regierungsrat in Zurich).
*   Its own **Courts**.

### Federalism
Switzerland follows the principle of **Subsidiarity**. This means that a task should be handled by the smallest possible unit (the Municipality or the Canton). The Confederation (Bund) only takes on tasks that the cantons cannot handle themselves (like the military or currency).

### Comparison
In other countries, these might be called **States** (USA, Germany), **Provinces** (Canada), or **Departments** (France). In Switzerland, we use the term "Kantone" (or "Stände").
