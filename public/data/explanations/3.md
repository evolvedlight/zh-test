# 🇨🇭 Confoederatio Helvetica

**From the official brochure:** "Confoederatio Helvetica (CH). Dieser Name steht zum Beispiel auf der 5-Franken-Münze."

Because Switzerland has four national languages (German, French, Italian, and Romansh), it uses a neutral Latin name to avoid favoring any single language on official documents, coins, and stamps.

- **Confoederatio** means "Confederation" or "Alliance".
- **Helvetica** refers to the Helvetians, an ancient Celtic tribe that lived in the area of modern-day Switzerland during the Roman era.

This is also why the country code for Switzerland is **CH** (e.g., in web addresses `.ch` or on car stickers).
