# 🗳️ Who Elects the Federal Council?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The seven members of the Federal Council are elected by the **National Council and the Council of States** (meeting as the United Federal Assembly).

### Not a Direct Election
In many countries (like the USA or France), the people elect the president or government directly. In Switzerland, the people elect the **Parliament**, and the Parliament then elects the **Government**.
*   **Term:** Each member is elected for 4 years.
*   **Stability:** Members are almost always re-elected. They usually serve until they decide to retire. It is very rare for a sitting Federal Councillor not to be re-elected.

### Why this way?
This system promotes stability and "Concordance." The Parliament ensures that the government represents the major political parties proportionally, according to the "Magic Formula."
