# 🏘️ The Role of a Quartierverein

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A "Quartierverein" (Neighborhood Association) is a voluntary group that **represents the interests of residents towards the authorities and promotes social life**.

### Community and Advocacy
Quartiervereine are very active in the City of Zurich and larger towns.
1.  **Social Life:** They organize neighborhood festivals (e.g., Räbeliechtli processions, summer parties) and maintain community centers (Quartiertreffs).
2.  **Politics:** They act as a bridge between the residents and the city government. If there is a plan to change a bus route or build a new park, the Quartierverein gives feedback on behalf of the neighbors.
3.  **Identity:** They help people feel "at home" in their specific part of the city.

### Membership
Unlike the municipality itself, membership in a Quartierverein is **voluntary** (c). They have no formal legal power (d) and do not regulate laws like the federal or cantonal governments (a).
