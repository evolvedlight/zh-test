# 🏔️ Shrinking Glaciers: Climate Change

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Swiss glaciers are shrinking primarily because of **climate change** (global warming).

### The Melting Alps
Since the mid-19th century, the volume of Swiss glaciers has decreased by more than 60%.
*   **The Cause:** Rising temperatures caused by human-made greenhouse gas emissions. The Alps are heating up twice as fast as the global average.
*   **Impact:**
    1.  **Water Supply:** Glaciers are natural "water towers." Their melting affects the water levels of major European rivers (Rhine, Rhone) and hydropower production.
    2.  **Natural Hazards:** Melting permafrost makes mountain slopes unstable, increasing the risk of landslides and rockfalls.
    3.  **Landscape:** The loss of glaciers dramatically changes the iconic high-mountain scenery of Switzerland.

### Protection
While local measures (like covering some glacier parts with white blankets) can slow the melting locally, the long-term survival of glaciers depends on global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.
*   **Other options:** Tourism (b), ski races (c), or summer rain (d) have only very minor or no impact on the overall mass balance of glaciers compared to the rising average temperatures.
