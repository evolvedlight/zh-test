# 📄 The Job Reference: Arbeitszeugnis

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: An "Arbeitszeugnis" is a **document issued by the employer that provide information about the performance and behavior of the employee**.

### Your Right to a Reference
In Switzerland, every employee has the legal right (OR Art. 330a) to receive a reference at any time.
*   **Content:** It must include the type and duration of the work, as well as an evaluation of the performance (how well the work was done) and conduct (how the person behaved towards colleagues and customers).
*   **Truth and Goodwill:** It must be **truthful** but also formulated with **goodwill** (benevolent) to avoid making the employee's future career impossible.
*   **Interim Reference:** You can also ask for an "Zwischenzeugnis" while you are still working at a company.

### Why is it important?
When you apply for a new job in Switzerland, the "Arbeitszeugnisse" from your previous employers are often the most important documents after your CV.
