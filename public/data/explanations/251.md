# 🩺 The Black Death: The Plague in Zurich

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: Between 1611 and 1635, nearly half of Zurich's population died from the **Plague** (Pest).

### The Great Epidemic
The "Black Death" struck Switzerland several times in the 17th century.
*   **The Impact:** In the year 1611 alone, about 10% of Zurich's residents died. In 1629 and 1635, more waves followed.
*   **Causes:** The plague was spread by fleas on rats. Because people lived in crowded conditions with poor hygiene, the disease spread rapidly.
*   **Consequences:** The massive loss of life led to labor shortages and economic hardship, but it also forced the city to improve its public health measures and cemetery management.

### Comparison
While the Spanish Flu (d) killed many people in 1918, and COVID-19 (b) was a recent pandemic, the scale of death caused by the plague in the 17th century remains the most devastating health catastrophe in Zurich's recorded history.
