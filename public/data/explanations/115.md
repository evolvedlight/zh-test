# 🚗 Vehicle Admission: Strassenverkehrsamt

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(c)**: The **Strassenverkehrsamt** (Road Traffic Office) is the authority that allows motor vehicles to be used on public roads.

### The Process of Admission (Zulassung)
Before you can drive a car on a Swiss road, the Strassenverkehrsamt must check:
1.  **Technical Safety:** The car must meet all Swiss technical regulations (Motorfahrzeugkontrolle - MFK).
2.  **Insurance:** You must prove that you have mandatory **Liability Insurance** (Haftpflichtversicherung) to cover damages to others.
3.  **Registration:** The car is assigned a unique number plate (e.g., ZH 123 456).

### Why a Central Office?
This ensures that all vehicles on the road are safe and that the owner can be identified in case of an accident. It is a cantonal task, so the rules and the layout of the plates are consistent across the whole Canton of Zurich.
