# 🏫 Responsibility for Primary Education

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The **Cantons and Municipalities** are primarily responsible for the "Volksschule" (public primary and secondary education).

### Cantonal Sovereignty
In Switzerland, education is not a central federal task.
*   **The Canton:** Sets the laws, defines the curriculum (Lehrplan 21), and oversees teacher training.
*   **The Municipality:** Builds the schools, hires the teachers, and pays for the materials.
*   **The Bund:** Only has a very limited role. It ensures that primary education is mandatory, free of charge, and of a certain quality, and it manages the ETH (Universities of Technology).

### Why?
This allows the education system to be adapted to regional needs and language regions. For example, a school in Zurich (German-speaking) has different needs than a school in Lugano (Italian-speaking).
*   **Other options (a, c, d):** These national bodies do not exist or do not have the power to run the local schools.
