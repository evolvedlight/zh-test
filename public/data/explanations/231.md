# ⛪ The Birth of Protestantism

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **Protestant faith** emerged as a new religious movement during the Reformation.

### The Great Schism
Starting in the early 16th century, reformers like Martin Luther (Germany), Huldrych Zwingli (Zurich), and John Calvin (Geneva) challenged the authority and practices of the Roman Catholic Church.
*   **Beliefs:** They emphasized "Scripture alone" (Sola Scriptura)—everyone should read the Bible in their own language—and faith as the only way to salvation.
*   **Simplification:** They removed statues, paintings, and elaborate rituals from churches, focusing on the sermon instead.
*   **Economic Impact:** The "Protestant Work Ethic" is often cited as a reason for the rapid industrial and financial development of cities like Zurich and Geneva.

### Today
Switzerland remains a multi-confessional country. While the divide between Protestants and Catholics was once a source of war, today it is a matter of personal choice, and both groups work together in the interest of the state.
