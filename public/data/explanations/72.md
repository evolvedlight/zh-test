# ⚖️ The Role of Judges

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: The task of judges (Richter) is to **pass court judgments**.

### What they do
Judges apply the laws passed by Parliament to specific cases.
*   **Civil Law:** Disputes between private individuals (e.g., divorce, inheritance, contract disputes).
*   **Criminal Law:** Deciding if someone committed a crime and what the punishment should be (e.g., theft, assault).
*   **Administrative Law:** Disputes between citizens and the state (e.g., an unfair tax bill or a denied building permit).

### What they do NOT do
*   **Defend the accused (c):** That is the job of a **Lawyer** (Rechtsanwalt).
*   **Write laws (d):** That is the job of the **Parliament** (Legislative).
*   **Oversee Administration (a):** While they can rule on administrative cases, they do not "manage" the civil service; that is the Executive's job.
