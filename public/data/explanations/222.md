# ⚖️ Constitutional Gender Equality: 1981

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: The sentence "Men and women have equal rights" has been in the Federal Constitution since **1981**.

### The Struggle for Equality
While women received the right to vote in 1971, full legal equality in other areas (like family law and wages) took longer.
*   **The Vote:** In June 1981, Swiss citizens (at that point, men and women) voted on a new constitutional article regarding gender equality. It passed with 60% "Yes."
*   **The Article:** Article 8, Para. 3 now states: *"Men and women have equal rights. The law shall provide for their equality, both in law and in fact, especially in the family, in education, and in work. Men and women have the right to equal pay for work of equal value."*
*   **Consequences:** This led to a total revision of the **Marriage Law** in 1988 (ending the husband's role as "head of the family") and the introduction of the **Gender Equality Act** in 1996.

This article is the legal basis for all modern efforts to close the "gender pay gap" and ensure equal opportunities in the workplace.
