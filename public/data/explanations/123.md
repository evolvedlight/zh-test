# 🗳️ Political Decisions at the Local Level

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: Citizens decide on municipal matters by **participating in elections and votes**.

### Exercising the Mandate
While attending festivals (a) or joining clubs (c) is good for social integration, it is not a "political decision-making" power. Paying taxes (b) is a duty, not a right to decide.
*   **Elections:** Every 4 years, citizens elect the local government (Stadtrat/Gemeinderat) and parliament.
*   **Votes:** Citizens vote on local initiatives, referendums, and the annual budget (either at the ballot box or in a Gemeindeversammlung).

### Impact
At the local level, your vote has the most direct impact. A few dozen votes can decide whether a new park is built, whether the tax rate goes down, or who leads the local school board.
