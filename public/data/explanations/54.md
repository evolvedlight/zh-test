# 🌍 Protecting the Environment

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(b)**: A major task of the Confederation (Bund) is **ensuring the protection of the environment**.

### Federal Laws
The Bund passes national laws that all cantons must follow, such as:
*   **The Environmental Protection Act:** Dealing with air pollution, noise, and harmful substances.
*   **The Water Protection Act:** Ensuring our lakes and rivers stay clean.
*   **Climate Policy:** Setting targets for reducing CO2 emissions.

### Sustainability
Article 2 of the Federal Constitution states that one of the purposes of the Swiss Confederation is to promote "sustainable development" and the preservation of natural resources for future generations.

### What the Bund does NOT do:
*   **Interest Rates (c):** Setting interest rates is the exclusive job of the independent **Swiss National Bank (SNB)**.
*   **Car Production (a):** Switzerland does not have a state-owned car industry.
*   **Power Plants (d):** While the state regulates energy, most electricity works are owned by cantons, municipalities, or private companies.
