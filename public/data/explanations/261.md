# 🌍 Origin of Foreign Residents: The EU

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(a)**: About two-thirds of the foreign population in Switzerland **come from an EU country**.

### Proximity and Integration
Due to its central location in Europe and the "Free Movement of Persons" agreement with the European Union, Switzerland is a major destination for EU citizens.
*   **Main Groups:** The largest groups come from **Italy, Germany, Portugal, and France**.
*   **Reasons:** Most come for work, as the Swiss labor market offers high wages and many opportunities for skilled professionals.
*   **Cultural Fit:** Because many share a national language (German, French, or Italian), integration is often very successful.

### Other Options
While Italians (b) are the largest single nationality among foreigners, they do not make up "two-thirds" on their own. English (c) is a common business language, but not the primary language for most immigrants. The foreign population is distributed across the whole country (d), with particularly high concentrations in urban centers like Zurich and Geneva.
