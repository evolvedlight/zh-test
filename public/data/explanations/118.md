# 🏛️ Who Elects the City Parliament?

### The Core Definition
The correct answer is **(d)**: The **people (eligible voters)** of the City of Zurich elect the **Gemeinderat** (the city parliament).

### Representing the People
The Gemeinderat of Zurich consists of **125 members**.
*   **Term:** They are elected every 4 years.
*   **Proportionality:** Seats are distributed among parties based on their share of the vote.
*   **The Sovereign:** As with all democratic institutions in Switzerland, the power ultimately comes from the "Sovereign"—the voters.

### Don't confuse the names!
In the City of Zurich:
*   **Stadtrat:** The Executive (9 members).

In smaller villages, "Gemeinderat" is often the name for the *Executive*. This can be confusing, so it's important to know the context of the City of Zurich!
