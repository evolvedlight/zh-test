# 🏛️ Confoederatio Helvetica (CH)

### Why Latin?
The correct answer is **(b)**. "Confoederatio Helvetica" is the Latin name for the Swiss Confederation. Switzerland uses Latin because it has **four official national languages** (German, French, Italian, Romansh). Choosing one language for the country's official name or abbreviation would have been seen as favoring that language group.

### Historical Roots
The name "Helvetica" comes from the **Helvetii**, a Celtic tribe that inhabited the Swiss plateau before the Roman conquest in 58 BC. The Romans called the region "Helvetia." When the modern federal state was formed in 1848, the founders needed a neutral, unifying name.

### Everyday Use
You see this heritage everywhere today:
* **CH:** The country code on car stickers and internet domains (.ch).
* **Coins:** Swiss francs bear the inscription "Confoederatio Helvetica" or "Helvetia" to avoid printing the text in four languages.
* **Helvetia:** The female national personification (Mother Helvetia) appears on stamps and coins, symbolizing the unity of the confederation.
